My friends and I were talking about a trip when we realized we had a four-day weekend coming up. Unfortunately, my car registration was expiring on the 16th, and I wouldn't be able to renew it during the Eid holiday because all the RTA offices would be closed.

One of my friends suggested a last-minute trip to see the Milky Way in Abu Dhabi, which was about 240 kilometers away. We packed up quickly and left Dubai at around 9:30pm in two cars, mine and my friend Vijendra's.

Since I was using the Waze app with the "avoid tolls" option selected, it took us on a completely unexpected route through a remote area. It was dark and deserted, with only our headlights illuminating the road. We were a little scared, but we kept going, figuring we would eventually meet up with Vijendra who was taking the normal route through Abu Dhabi.

After a while, we reached a point where there weren't even any streetlights. We stopped the cars, got out, and ate some snacks together. We were definitely considering turning back at this point, but eventually decided to press on.

After another 30-40 minutes of driving, we finally arrived at our destination. The view of the Milky Way was incredible! We could see millions of stars with our naked eyes. We spread out some mats and pillows from our cars, laid down, and gazed up at the sky. It was an amazing experience.

We played some games and sang songs together under the stars. As the night went on, the sun began to rise, casting a beautiful glow over the desert landscape. We took lots of pictures and enjoyed a delicious breakfast of Maggi noodles cooked by my friend Riya.

Exhausted from our lack of sleep, we decided to head back to Dubai. We stopped at the Corniche Beach to freshen up and escape the heat. We then went to the Marina Mall to get some air conditioning and have lunch.

After lunch, some of our friends had to leave because they weren't feeling well. My wife Shilpa, my friend Sunny, his wife Sangita, and I decided to make the most of the rest of the day.

We visited the Gurunanak Darbar Gurudwara, a Sikh temple. It was a peaceful and beautiful place, and we were happy to be able to visit a place of worship for our religion while in another country.

Next, we went to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, the largest mosque in the United Arab Emirates. It was absolutely stunning, with intricate architecture and beautiful details. It was definitely one of the most impressive buildings I've ever seen.

For our final stop, we went to the BAPS Hindu Temple. It felt like a little piece of India in the UAE. There were thousands of people there, and the atmosphere was very religious. We attended the Ganga Aarti ceremony, which was a very special experience.

We finally left the temple around 8pm and headed back to Dubai, where we arrived around 11pm. It was a whirlwind trip, but we packed a lot in and saw some amazing things.
