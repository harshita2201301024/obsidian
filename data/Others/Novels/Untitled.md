It was 15th June 2024 5PM, I was sitting with my friends and we were talking about planning a trip as their were 4 days of office leaves. i told them trip is not possible because my vehicle is expiring by 16th June after that i won't drive as i can't renew during eid holiday because all of the rta offices are closed. someone said lets leave today night and will be back by tomorrow night til the time vehicle is valid. big question was where to. one of my friend name heart said let's go watch milky way in abu dhabi. i checked the distance it was around 240km. we all said okay. 4 friends with there wife. aakash shilpa, heart riya, vijendra manisha, sunny sangita and his children jivansh. we started packing and left for the trip around 9: 30pm from dubai to al qua milkyway destination. 2 cars mine and vijendra. but as it was unplanned trip unexpected things were bound to happen. I use waze application for navigation. in my waze application, there is a option to avoid toll and it was checked to true. as it was checked to true that toll roads will not come on the way. waze application showed me totally different path through the remote area not through the main abu dhabi. no car was on the road except our car and on both side it was completely dark because of desert but there were street light. it was around 10:10PM, everyone was afraid that where we are heading to. we were making silly jokes that what if our car stops here. vijendra's car was following the right pay via abudhabi way. we were continuously on call with them that we took the remote area and somewhere in future we will meet but don't know when.  it was too dark on both left and right side. only thing that kept us going was street light. after driving for almost 150m-160km. vijendra's car also came on remote path after crossing abu dhabi. after driving for a few km there was a point when no street lights wes there. it was completely dark outside with card headlights on. vijendra and me we both parked our car on the way and we all came out of the car and sat along the road. we all ate samosa with cold drinking and thinking whether to go ahead or not. we were too scared of the dark and still journey was 50-60km ahead. we had fun
