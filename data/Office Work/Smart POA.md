Question
Mobile design
1. Do we have to change Add Delegation to Add Smart POA - yes
2. Do we have to change Disable to Revoke??? if no, they both shouldn't have the same color - yes
3. POA Document View in table  Design??
4. POA Document Signature in table will redirect to notifications??
5. Why Add New Delegation return on Details Screen??
6. What does it mean by save and exit??? on POA Details Page
7. Do we have to show less fields in Delegation details tab
8. what is lorem ipsum ?? View and Sign POA
9. Will it take you to delegation screen for signing?? i don't think so?? If Yes, what will happen on back button click??
10. Every Delegation Detail will show this steps??
11. By Default it will be POA Details for everyone ??
12. Why it showing license is revoked?? we have revoked the delegation
13. License Revoked in my inbox, what it will show on view button
14. where we will have edit button, i think it is missing in design or replaced with clone delegation
15. what after clonning the POA Details


Do we have new filters??
1. The investor will search delegate by (EID, Year of Birth and Gender)  
    
2. The system will allow selection of only delegates with active accounts (Verified profile exists in IID) and whose identity documents are not expired (at least passport or EID should be valid)
3. The system will not allow adding a new POA to the same person who already has an initiated/active/pending signature/pending payment delegation  
    
4. The system will not allow adding a new smart POA for a delegate who has a legacy delegation that is pending for back office approval.
