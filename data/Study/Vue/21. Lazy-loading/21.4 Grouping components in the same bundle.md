It often makes sense to load several components at the same time, instead of having one bundle for
each lazy-loaded component.

When using Vite, youâ€™ll need to declare which dynamic imports you want to group inside the Vite
configuration, using the build.rollupOptions property:

```js
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
vue({
features: {
propsDestructure: true
}
}),
],
build: {
rollupOptions: {
// https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#outputmanualchunks
output: {
manualChunks: {
races: [
'./src/views/Races.vue',
'./src/views/Pony.vue'
// all other imports to group...
]
}
}
}
}
});
```
