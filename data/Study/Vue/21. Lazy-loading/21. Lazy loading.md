When the application grows in size and features, loading the whole application at once can become
a problem: the application bundle is too large and takes too much time to load and parse.
Moreover, some parts of the application are only used by some users, or are used rarely, and
loading them eagerly is a waste of time and bandwidth. This is where lazy-loading is useful.
