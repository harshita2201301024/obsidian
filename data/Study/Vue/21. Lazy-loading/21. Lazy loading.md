When the application grows in size and features, loading the whole application at once can become
a problem: the application bundle is too large and takes too much time to load and parse.
Moreover, some parts of the application are only used by some users, or are used rarely, and
loading them eagerly is a waste of time and bandwidth. This is where lazy-loading is useful.

Lazy loading consists in splitting the application into multiple JavaScript bundles, and loading them
only when they are necessary

Lazy loading is configured at the component level. This means that each component can be loaded
lazily, either when it needs to be displayed inside the vue of another component, or when it is the
component displayed by a route, and the user navigates to that route. In both cases, the same
technique is used to dynamically load the component: a dynamic JavaScript/TypeScript import.
