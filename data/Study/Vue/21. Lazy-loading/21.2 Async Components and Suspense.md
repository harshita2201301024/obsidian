We showed how we can use Suspense to dynamically load the data needed by a component and
display an alternative while the data is loading. We can also use Suspense to lazily load the
component itself, and display an alternative while the component is loading.

Letâ€™s illustrate that with the PendingRaces asynchronous component:

```js
<div>
<h1>Ponyracer</h1>
<Suspense>
<PendingRaces />
<template #fallback>Loading...</template>
</Suspense>
</div>
```
