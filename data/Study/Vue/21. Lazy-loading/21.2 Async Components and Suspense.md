We showed how we can use Suspense to dynamically load the data needed by a component and
display an alternative while the data is loading. We can also use Suspense to lazily load the
component itself, and display an alternative while the component is loading.

Let’s illustrate that with the PendingRaces asynchronous component:

```js
<div>
<h1>Ponyracer</h1>
<Suspense>
<PendingRaces />
<template #fallback>Loading...</template>
</Suspense>
</div>
```

This will automatically display Loading… while the component is loading.

You can also have a similar behavior without using Suspense. defineAsyncComponent can also take an
object as argument, allowing specifying:

• a loadingComponent, to specify what to display while loading;
• an errorComponent, to specify what to display in case of an error;
• a delay, to specify after how long you want the loading indicator to appear;
• a timeout, to specify how long you want to wait before considering that the loading has failed
and showing an error (the component still displays after that if it finally resolves).

```js
const PendingRaces = defineAsyncComponent({
loader: () => import('./PendingRaces.vue'),
delay: 100,
timeout: 2000,
loadingComponent: defineComponent({ template: 'Loading' }),
// or just use another component or a simple function like the following
errorComponent: () => 'An error occurred while loading'
});
```
