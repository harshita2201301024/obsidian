A more common use-case is to lazily load a component associated to a route: when the user clicks
on a link to navigate to a route, the route’s component must be lazily loaded first, before the
navigation is done.

It’s pretty straightforward: you use the same dynamic import syntax, but in the route declaration:

```js
{
path: '/races',
component: () => import('@/views/Races.vue')
},
```

And you’re done! The bundler will create a separate bundle for the Races component, and that
bundle will be loaded only when the user navigates to the /races route.
