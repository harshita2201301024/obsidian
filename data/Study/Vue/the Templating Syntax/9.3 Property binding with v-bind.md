Interpolation is only one of the ways to have dynamic parts in your template.

In Vue, every attribute of HTML elements can take a dynamic value, not with the mustaches, but by prefixing the attribute with v-bind:.

v-bind is what we call a directive in Vue. Vue offers several directives that weâ€™ll see in details, butyou can easily recognize them from standard HTML as they begin with v-.

So if you want an image with a dynamic source attribute, for example a property of our component called dynamicUrl, you can write:

```
<img v-bind:src="dynamicUrl" />
```
