Interpolation is only one of the ways to have dynamic parts in your template.

In Vue, every attribute of HTML elements can take a dynamic value, not with the mustaches, but by prefixing the attribute with v-bind:.

v-bind is what we call a directive in Vue. Vue offers several directives that weâ€™ll see in details, butyou can easily recognize them from standard HTML as they begin with v-.

So if you want an image with a dynamic source attribute, for example a property of our component called dynamicUrl, you can write:

```
<img v-bind:src="dynamicUrl" />
```

It also works with boolean attributes, like disabled or selected, which are slightly different, as what matters in HTML is if they present or not. With Vue, you can give a value to these boolean
attributes, and if the value is "truthy" in the JavaScript sense, i.e. not false, null, undefined, an
empty string or 0, then the attribute is considered present:

```
_<button_ _v-bind:disabled=__"isDisabled"__>__Log in__</button>_
```
