Interpolation is only one of the ways to have dynamic parts in your template.

In Vue, every attribute of HTML elements can take a dynamic value, not with the mustaches, but by prefixing the attribute with v-bind:.

v-bind is what we call a directive in Vue. Vue offers several directives that we’ll see in details, butyou can easily recognize them from standard HTML as they begin with v-.

So if you want an image with a dynamic source attribute, for example a property of our component called dynamicUrl, you can write:

```
<img v-bind:src="dynamicUrl" />
```

It also works with boolean attributes, like disabled or selected, which are slightly different, as what matters in HTML is if they present or not. With Vue, you can give a value to these boolean
attributes, and if the value is "truthy" in the JavaScript sense, i.e. not false, null, undefined, an
empty string or 0, then the attribute is considered present:

```
<button v-bind:disabled="isDisabled">Log in</button>
```

9.3.1 Shorthand syntax

You can also write a shorter version of v-bind:attribute by using :attribute. This is super handy,
and most Vue developers prefer this shorthand syntax:

```
<img :src="dynamicUrl" />
<button :disabled="isDisabled">Log in</button>
```

9.3.2 Properties and attributes

I’ve been talking about attributes since the beginning of this section, but its title is "Property
binding" and not "Attribute binding". Why is that?

The title is referring to DOM properties, but maybe this is not clear for you what the difference is. What we write is HTML markup, containing tags with attributes, right? Let’s take this simple HTML

```
<div>{{ user.name }}</div>
```

```
<div :textContent="user.name"></div>
```

The mechanic implemented for v-bind:something="value" in Vue is very simple:
• first it tries to set the property something if it exists
• otherwise it sets the attribute something to value, or removes it if the value is null.

9.3.3. v-bind with an object

It is also possible to use v-bind without a parameter (no :property), and to give it an object directly. In that case, the directive binds all the keys of the object:

```
<button v-bind="buttonProperties">Log in</button>
```

```
setup() { return { buttonProperties: ref({ disabled: true, type: 'button' as
const }), }; }
```

9.3.4. Classes and styles

It is fairly common in Web development to compute the CSS classes or styles that need to be applied to an element. You can certainly do so manually in your component, for example, build a string computedClasses, containing all the classes you want to apply and then use :class="computedClasses" in your template. Or :style="computedStyles" with a string containing all the styles.

```
<button class="btn" :class="{ 'btn-primary': isPrimary, 'btn-sm': isSmall }">Log
in</button>
```

```
setup() {
return {
isPrimary: ref(true),
isSmall: ref(false),
};
```

```
<button class="btn" :class="buttonClasses">Log in</button>
```

```
setup() {
return {
buttonClasses: ref({
'btn-primary': true,
'btn-small': false
}),
};
}
```

```
<div :style="textStyle">Some text</div>
```

```
setup() {
return {
textStyle: ref({
71
color: 'red',
fontWeight: 'bold' as const
})
}
```
