```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Ponyracer</h1>
    <Races />
  </div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent } from "vue"
  export default defineComponent({
    name: "App",
  })
</script>

```

As you can see, we added the Races component in the template, by including a tag whose name
matches the name we defined for the Races component.
Buuuuuut, that will not work: your browser will not display the races component.
If you open the developer console, youâ€™ll see:

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">_'[Vue warn]: Failed to resolve component: Races'_</mark>

9.2.1. Local registration

But the fix is simple. In our App component, we can add a components field, to register the
components we are using in its template. The syntax is very straightforward: components is an
object, and you can add a key, which is the name of the element you want to use in your template, and a corresponding value, which is the type of the component you want to use to replace this element.

Here we add a Races key, as this is the element we added in our template, and a Races value, the component we want to use. Of course, we have to import the Races component from the file we declared it.

```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Ponyracer</h1>
    67
    <Races />
  </div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent } from "vue"
  import Races from "@/chapters/templates/Races.vue"
  export default defineComponent({
    name: "App",
    components: {
      Races: Races,
    },
  })
</script>

```
