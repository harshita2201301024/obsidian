```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Ponyracer</h1>
    <Races />
  </div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent } from "vue"
  export default defineComponent({
    name: "App",
  })
</script>

```

As you can see, we added the Races component in the template, by including a tag whose name
matches the name we defined for the Races component.
Buuuuuut, that will not work: your browser will not display the races component.
If you open the developer console, youâ€™ll see:

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">_'[Vue warn]: Failed to resolve component: Races'_</mark>
