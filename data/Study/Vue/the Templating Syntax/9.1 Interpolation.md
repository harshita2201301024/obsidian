```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Ponyracer</h1>
    <h2>{{ numberOfUsers }} users</h2>
  </div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent } from "vue"
  export default defineComponent({
    name: "App",
    setup() {
      return { numberOfUsers: 146 }
    },
  })
</script>

```

Note that the wrapping div is not necessary as Vue templates now allow having several root
elements (that was not the case until Vue 3.0).

So when you want to update your reactive property, you have to update its value. But you can still use the ref in the template as is, without having to use .value: Vue is automatically unwrapping the value for you.
