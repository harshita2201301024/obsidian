```
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Ponyracer</h1>
    <h2>{{ numberOfUsers }} users</h2>
  </div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent } from "vue"
  export default defineComponent({
    name: "App",
    setup() {
      return { numberOfUsers: 146 }
    },
  })
</script>

```

Note that the wrapping div is not necessary as Vue templates now allow having several root
elements (that was not the case until Vue 3.0).

So when you want to update your reactive property, you have to update its value. But you can still use the ref in the template as is, without having to use .value: Vue is automatically unwrapping the value for you.

One important fact to remember: if we try to display a property that does not exist, then, instead of displaying undefined, Vue is going to display an empty string. The same will happen for a null property.
Letâ€™s say that, instead of a simple value, our first component has a more complex user object,
reflecting the current user

What happens if we have a typo in our template, with a property that does not exist in the
component?

<template>
<div>
<h1>Ponyracer</h1>
<!-- Note the typo: `users` instead of `user` -->
<h2>Welcome {{ users.name }}</h2>
</div>
</template>
```
<template>
<div>
<h1>Ponyracer</h1>
<!-- Note the typo: `users` instead of `user` -->
<h2>Welcome {{ users.name }}</h2>
</div>
</template>
```
