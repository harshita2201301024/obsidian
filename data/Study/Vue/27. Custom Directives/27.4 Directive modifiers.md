Last but not least, a directive can have modifiers. For example, the v-model directive can have a
number modifier to indicate that the value should be parsed as a number. Our custom directives can
have modifiers, as you guessed.
\
We can imagine a v-focus directive that would have a seconds modifier to indicate that the focus
delay is in seconds (and not in milliseconds) for example. It can be used like this:

```js
<input v-focus.seconds:2="shouldFocus" name="login" @blur="shouldFocus = false" />
```

The modifiers are available in the binding object, in the modifiers property. If a modifier is present,
then the value of the property is true.
So the directive can be defined like this:

```js
import { Directive } from 'vue';
// called when the bound element is mounted to the DOM
// and when the containing component has updated
export const vFocus: Directive<HTMLInputElement, boolean> = (el, binding) => {
// if the modifiers object contains a `seconds` property, then we need to multiply
the delay by 1000
const isDelayInSeconds = binding.modifiers['seconds'];
const delay = parseInt(binding.arg ?? '0') * (isDelayInSeconds ? 1000 : 1);
if (binding.value) {
setTimeout(() => el.focus(), delay);
}
};
```
