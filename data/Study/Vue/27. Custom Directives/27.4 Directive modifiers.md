Last but not least, a directive can have modifiers. For example, the v-model directive can have a
number modifier to indicate that the value should be parsed as a number. Our custom directives can
have modifiers, as you guessed.
\
We can imagine a v-focus directive that would have a seconds modifier to indicate that the focus
delay is in seconds (and not in milliseconds) for example. It can be used like this:

```js
<input v-focus.seconds:2="shouldFocus" name="login" @blur="shouldFocus = false" />
```
