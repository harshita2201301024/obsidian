A directive can also have an argument. For example, the v-bind directive can have an argument to
indicate the attribute to bind with v-bind:src. The v-on directive can have an argument to indicate
the event to listen to with v-on:click. Our custom directives can have arguments too!

We can imagine a v-focus directive that would have an argument to indicate a delay before
focusing the element. For example, it can be used like this:

```js
<input v-focus:300="shouldFocus" name="login" @blur="shouldFocus = false" />
```

The argument is available in the binding object, in the arg property. It is a string, so we have to
convert it to a number in our case. So the directive can be defined like this:

```js
import { Directive } from 'vue';
// called when the bound element is mounted to the DOM
// and when the containing component has updated
export const vFocus: Directive<HTMLInputElement, boolean> = (el, binding) => {
const delay = parseInt(binding.arg ?? '0');
if (binding.value) {
setTimeout(() => el.focus(), delay);
}
};
```
