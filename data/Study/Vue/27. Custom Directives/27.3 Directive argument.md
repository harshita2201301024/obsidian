A directive can also have an argument. For example, the v-bind directive can have an argument to
indicate the attribute to bind with v-bind:src. The v-on directive can have an argument to indicate
the event to listen to with v-on:click. Our custom directives can have arguments too!

We can imagine a v-focus directive that would have an argument to indicate a delay before
focusing the element. For example, it can be used like this:

```js
<input v-focus:300="shouldFocus" name="login" @blur="shouldFocus = false" />
```
