You may have noticed that some Vue directives can have values, for example v-model="user.name".
Some can have an argument like v-bind:src or v-on:click. And some can be used with modifiers,
like v-model.number.

We can imagine a really fancy v-focus directive that would have all of these! For example, it can
have a value to indicate if the element should be focused or not. It would be used like this:\\

```js
<input v-focus="shouldFocus" name="login" @blur="shouldFocus = false" />
```

Each lifecycle hook can receive a second parameter, usually called binding. binding is an object that
contains the value, the parameters and the modifiers. So the directive would be defined like this:

```js
import { Directive } from 'vue';
export const vFocus: Directive<HTMLInputElement, boolean> = {
// called when the bound element is mounted to the DOM
mounted(el, binding) {
// as vFocus is declared as Directive<HTMLInputElement, boolean>
// `binding` is inferred as `DirectiveBinding<boolean>`,
// so `binding.value` is of type boolean
if (binding.value) {
el.focus();
}
},
// called after the containing component has re-rendered
updated(el, binding) {
if (binding.value) {
el.focus();
}
}
};
```

The directive uses two lifecycle hooks: mounted and updated. The first one is called when the element
is mounted in the DOM. The second one is called when the containing component has re-rendered.

As it is a fairly common use case, Vue allows defining the directive as a function, that will be called
on mount and on update:

```JS
import { Directive } from 'vue';
// called when the bound element is mounted to the DOM
// and when the containing component has re-rendered
export const vFocus: Directive<HTMLInputElement, boolean> = (el, binding) => {
// as vFocus is declared as Directive<HTMLInputElement, boolean>
// `binding` is inferred as `DirectiveBinding<boolean>`,
// so `binding.value` is of type boolean
if (binding.value) {
el.focus();
}
};
```
