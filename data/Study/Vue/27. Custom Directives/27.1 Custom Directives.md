Vue offers a bunch of directives that you can use in your templates (v-if, v-for, v-model, etc.), but
you can also build your own!

This can be very handy to encapsulate a behavior that you want to reuse several times, but that is
not really a component (because it has no template) nor a composable (because its purpose is to
manipulate the DOM).

For example, in the previous chapter, we saw how to focus an element in the template thanks to
template references. This code works perfectly, but we would have to duplicate it every time we
want to focus an element.

How can we do better? With a directive!

To define a directive, you create an object that can have several properties, corresponding to the
directive lifecycle hooks you want to use.
