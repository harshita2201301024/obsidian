Vue comes with directives, a powerful feature that we already used with v-bind and v-on. But there are some others, some really useful, and others which are good to know but less frequently used.

Let’s start with the one you’re going to use daily: v-if.

_10.1. Conditions in templates with_ _v-if_

```
<div v-if="user.role === 'ADMIN'">
<h2>Admin {{ user.name }}</h2>
</div>
<div v-else-if="user.role === 'ACCOUNTANT'">
<h2>Accountant</h2>
</div>
<div v-else-if="user.role === 'DEVELOPER'">
<h2>Developer</h2>
</div>
<div v-else>
<h2>Hello</h2>
</div>
```
