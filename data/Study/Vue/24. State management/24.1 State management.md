In a well-designed web application, the state should be stored on the server, and in the URL. You
should be able to refresh any page (and thus restart the application), and get back to where you
were before: the URL allows remembering where you were, and the data displayed by that page is
stored on the server and retrieved thanks to the URL parameters.
