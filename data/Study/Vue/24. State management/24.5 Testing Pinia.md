Pinia comes with a tiny package called @pinia/testing that makes your life easier when it comes to
testing. The library offers a createPiniaTesting() function that does all the heavy lifting. By default,
it stubs all the actions, so we can easily test components that trigger them:

```js
import { createTestingPinia } from '@pinia/testing';
describe('NavbarWithPinia.vue', () => {
test('should logout the user', async () => {
// mount the component
const wrapper = mount(NavbarWithPinia, {
global: {
// with a "fake" pinia
plugins: [
createTestingPinia({
createSpy: vi.fn
})
]
}
});
// you can get the store, and change its state
const store = useAppStore();
const logout = wrapper.get('#logout');
await logout.trigger('click');
// actions are already spied,
// so you just have to check if they are properly called
expect(store.logout).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
});
```

In case that you donâ€™t want to stub the actions, you can use the stubActions: false option:
