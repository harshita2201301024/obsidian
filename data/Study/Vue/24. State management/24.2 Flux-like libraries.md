The store pattern is in fact our favorite way to handle state in an application. But it is not the only
one.
Some developers are in love with the Flux pattern, which is heavily inspired by the Elm framework,
and was popularized by the React ecosystem. The most known library in the React community is
Redux. You’ve probably heard that name already.
The Flux pattern and libraries like Redux encourage developers to not update the store directly, but
rather to dispatch actions. These actions are handled by reducers, in charge of updating the state.
Sounds confusing? It is at first, and can lead to over-complicated architectures.
In fact, the author of Redux himself, Dan Abramov, wrote a very famous blog post You might not
need Redux, because at some point everybody was putting Redux in their React application, even if
it was just complicating things for them. The Angular ecosystem is no stranger to this problem:
NgRx is quite popular, but it is very often useless, as Angular can handle state natively (with a
similar concept to the store pattern we saw above).
You may understand where this goes: I’m not sure you need something else than Vue to handle the
state of your application. You can start without third party libraries, and see how it goes: you’ll be
fine.
But I can see you’re curious, and want to check out the popular state management libraries in Vue.
Fine, let’s go!
