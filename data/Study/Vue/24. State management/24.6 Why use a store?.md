As stated above, the Composition API is enough in most cases.

A store like Pinia can be necessary in one scenario: server-side rendering (SSR). If your application
is rendered on the server (for example if you use Nuxt), then you’ll need to properly handle the
global state to avoid leaking the information from a user to another one if you’re not careful. As
manually written stores are usually singletons, they may lead to a well-known problem called
"cross-request state pollution". Pinia can help you to handle that: it even comes with a Nuxt
integration.

Other than that, a store like Pinia can be nice to have:

• for debugging, using the Devtools
• for testing, with its @pinia/testing package
• for its Hot Module Replacement support, allowing to update values in stores when we develop,
and see the results without having to reload the application
• for using existing plugins (or building your own)
