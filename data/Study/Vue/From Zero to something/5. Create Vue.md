create-vue is built on top of Vite, and provides templates for Vue 3 projects.
To get started, you simply use:

``` HTML
npm create vue@3
```

The npm create something command in fact downloads and executes the create-something package.
So here npm create vue executes the create-vue package.
You then have to choose:
• a project name
• if you want TypeScript or not
• if you want JSX or not
• if you want Vue router or not
• if you want Pinia (state management) or not
• if you want Vitest for unit testing or not
• if you want Cypress for e2e testing or not
• if you want ESLint/Prettier for linting and formatting or not
