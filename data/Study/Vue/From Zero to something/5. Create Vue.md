create-vue is built on top of Vite, and provides templates for Vue 3 projects.
To get started, you simply use:

``` HTML
npm create vue@3
```

The npm create something command in fact downloads and executes the create-something package.
So here npm create vue executes the create-vue package.
You then have to choose:
• a project name
• if you want TypeScript or not
• if you want JSX or not
• if you want Vue router or not
• if you want Pinia (state management) or not
• if you want Vitest for unit testing or not
• if you want Cypress for e2e testing or not
• if you want ESLint/Prettier for linting and formatting or not

and your project is ready!

We will of course deep-dive into all these technologies along the book.

To build your first Vite app, follow our online exercise Getting Started ! It’s part of our Pro Pack,
but is accessible to all of our readers.

Done?

If you followed the instructions (and reached a 100% score I hope!), you have an application up and running. Let’s look at a few files. The entry point of the application is a file called main.ts:

``` JAVASCRIPT
_import_ _'./assets/main.css'__;_

_import_ _{ createApp }_ _from_ _'vue'__;_

_import_ _App_ _from_ _'./App.vue'__;_

_createApp__(App).__mount__(__'#app'__);_

```
