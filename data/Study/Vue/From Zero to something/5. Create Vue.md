create-vue is built on top of Vite, and provides templates for Vue 3 projects.
To get started, you simply use:

``` HTML
npm create vue@3
```

The npm create something command in fact downloads and executes the create-something package.
So here npm create vue executes the create-vue package.
You then have to choose:
• a project name
• if you want TypeScript or not
• if you want JSX or not
• if you want Vue router or not
• if you want Pinia (state management) or not
• if you want Vitest for unit testing or not
• if you want Cypress for e2e testing or not
• if you want ESLint/Prettier for linting and formatting or not

and your project is ready!

We will of course deep-dive into all these technologies along the book.

To build your first Vite app, follow our online exercise Getting Started ! It’s part of our Pro Pack,
but is accessible to all of our readers.

Done?

If you followed the instructions (and reached a 100% score I hope!), you have an application up and running. Let’s look at a few files. The entry point of the application is a file called main.ts:

``` JAVASCRIPT
import './assets/main.css';
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
createApp(App).mount('#app');
```

It mounts an App component defined in App.vue, looking similar to this when created:

``` JAVASCRIPT
<script setup lang="ts">
  import HelloWorld from "./components/HelloWorld.vue"
  import TheWelcome from "./components/TheWelcome.vue"
</script>
<template>
  <header>
    59
    <img
      alt="Vue logo"
      class="logo"
      src="./assets/logo.svg"
      width="125"
      height="125"
    />
    <div class="wrapper">
      <HelloWorld msg="You did it!" />
    </div>
  </header>
  <main>
    <TheWelcome />
  </main>
</template>
<style scoped>
  header {
	  line-height: 1.5;
  }
</style>

```
