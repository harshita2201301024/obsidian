The idea behind Vite is that, as modern browsers support ES Modules, we can now use them
directly, at least during development, instead of generating a bundle.

So when you load a page in the browser when developing with Vite, you donâ€™t load a single large file of JS containing all the application: you load just the few ES modules needed for this page, each in their own file (and each over their own HTTP request). If an ES module has imports, then the browser loads these imports as well.

So Vite is mainly a dev server, in charge of answering the browser requests, and responding with the requested ES modules. As we may have written our code in TypeScript, or using SFC in .vue extension (see below), Vite sometimes needs to transform the files on our disk into a proper ES
module that the browser can understand. This is where esbuild comes into play! Vite is built on top of esbuild, and when a requested file needs to be transformed, it asks esbuild to do the job and then sends the result to the browser. If you change something in a file, then Vite only sends the updated module to the browser, instead of having to rebuild the whole bundle as Webpack-based tools do!
