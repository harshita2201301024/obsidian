A Single File Component (SFC) defines:

• the template in the template element
• the component definition in a script element. Note the lang="ts" attribute indicating we are
using TypeScript.
• the CSS of the component in a style element.

The tooling compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript for us. It also compiles the template to
JavaScript (we’ll explain in a later chapter what happens under the hood). The Vue compiler, unlike the browser, understands the PascalCase syntax, so we can use either <hello-world> or <HelloWorld> for our child component. We’ll use the PascalCase version from now on.
As you saw in the exercise, Vite can execute the unit tests, end-to-end tests, linter… Each exercise comes with the unit tests and e2e tests already written, so you’ll be able to check your code at every step. And Vite is super fast, so the developer experience is really enjoyable. Now that we peeked into what the tooling can do for us, and are ready to build more components, let’s move on to the template syntax.
