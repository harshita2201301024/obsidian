When you support several languages in your application, you probably want to provide a way to
switch the locale used in the application (or read the user preference on startup).

You can grab the current locale and the available ones thanks to useI18n():

```js
const { locale, availableLocales } = useI18n();
```

locale is a ref, so you can update its value, and Vue will refresh the templates to reflect it.\

You can for example add a simple select to your application to let the user switch the locale:

```js
<select v-model="locale">
<option v-for="availableLocale in availableLocales" :key="availableLocale"
:value="availableLocale">
{{ availableLocale }}
</option>
</select>
```

Note that t automatically refreshes the translations in the templates (as the function re-evaluates).
But not in your code: the function is executed once during the setup. If necessary, you can watch
the locale to trigger a refresh of the translation though:
