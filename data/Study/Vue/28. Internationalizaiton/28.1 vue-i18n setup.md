OK, don’t worry if you didn’t understand anything of this French introduction. Your role as a
developer, fortunately, is not to translate your application into French, Spanish, or whatever other
language. What you can do, though, is to allow this to happen. This chapter explains how to achieve
that.
Vue itself doesn’t do much for the internationalization part. But a plugin of the ecosystem is here to
the rescue: vue-i18n.
vue-i18n helps on two topics:
• translating text
• formatting numbers and dates

vue-i18n is a plugin that you can instantiate with createI18n(). The plugin allows defining the locale
of the application, and the translations you want to use.
