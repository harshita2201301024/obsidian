vue-i18n also helps with the formatting of dates with d(Date|string|number), and numbers with
n(number). Both functions are based on the browser Intl support, and allow specifying a pattern as
a second parameter if needed.
To grab these functions, you can use useI18n as usual:

```js
const { d, n, availableLocales, locale } = useI18n();
```

and then use them in templates:

```js
<div id="default-date">{{ d('2020-09-18') }}</div>
<!-- 9/18/2020 in English, 18/09/2020 in French -->
<div id="default-number">{{ n(2010.983) }}</div>
<!-- 2,010.983 in English, 2 010,983 in French -->
```
