vue-i18n comes with some nice additional features:
• advanced formatting options for numbers, dates and currencies
• a custom v-t directive that can be used instead of the t() function. The custom directive offers
some optimizations as it allows to pre-compile the translations. But it is less flexible and
necessitates a custom build.

• lazy-loading is possible to only fetch the translations when you need them
• Vite support via a plugin
You should feel ready to start internationalizing your application now!
