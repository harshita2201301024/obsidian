Let’s stop to talk about styles and CSS for a minute. I know right? Why talk about CSS?

Well because Vue (and Vite or Vue CLI) can do a lot of things for us behind the scenes.

As a Web developer, you often add CSS classes to elements. And the essence of CSS is that it will cascade. That’s sometimes what you want (to change the font everywhere in your app for example), and sometimes not. Imagine you want to add a style on a selected element in a list: you will usually use a very narrow CSS selector in your CSS, like li.selected. Or an even narrower one, using conventions like BEM, because you just want to style the selected element in a specific part of your app.

By default, when you add styles to your component (with the style part of an SFC), the styles are global, and applied to the complete application.

That’s where Vite or Vue CLI can be useful. The styles can be applied to this component and only this one. How does it achieve this?
