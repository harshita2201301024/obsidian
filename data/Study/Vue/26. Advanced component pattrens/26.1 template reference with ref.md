With modern JavaScript frameworks, we usually don’t manipulate the DOM ourselves, and let the
framework do the work for us.

But, sometimes, we need to grab a reference to a DOM element. Imagine that we want to focus an
input element for example. To do so, we want to call the native focus() method on the input. But
first, we need to grab a reference to the element.

This can be achieved using ref(). Yes, it is the same ref() function that we use in the reactivity
system, but for a slightly different usage.

Let’s start by creating the reference in our script section:

```js
const nameInput = ref<HTMLInputElement | null>(null);
```

Then use the name of this property (nameInput) as the value of the ref attribute of the HTML input
in the template:

```js
<input id="name" ref="nameInput" v-model="name" />
```

The type of nameInput is Ref<HTMLInputElement | null>, because its value is only available once Vue
has generated the DOM and populated the reference. When can we use nameInput then? In the
onMounted() lifecycle hook!

```js
onMounted(() => {
nameInput.value?.focus();
});
```

Note that this use case can also be solved with a custom directive, as we’ll see in the next chapter.

This pattern is really useful in some cases. For example, when you want to insert a chart or a map
in a component, you often have to use a third-party library, which doesn’t know about Vue. In that
case, simply grab the DOM reference you need and feed it to the third-party library.
