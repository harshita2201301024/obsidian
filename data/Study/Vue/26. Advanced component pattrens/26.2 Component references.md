This pattern also works with Vue components! Let’s say you have a dropdown component (yours,
or a third-party one, it doesn’t matter).

This dropdown component has a function to open/close the dropdown.

```js
const opened = ref(true);
function toggle() {
opened.value = !opened.value;
}
defineExpose({
toggle
});
```

As the component is defined with the script setup syntax, the function has to be exposed with
defineExpose to be visible outside the component.
This dropdown component can be used like this:

```js
<Dropdown ref="dropdown">
<button>First choice</button>
<button>Second choice</button>
</Dropdown>
<button class="toggle" @click="toggleDropdown()">Open the dropdown</button>
```

You can see below that the dropdown has a ref called dropdown. This ref is declared in the script
section, and can be used to access the dropdown component instance and its methods.

```js
const dropdown = ref<typeof Dropdown | null>(null);
function toggleDropdown() {
dropdown.value?.toggle();
}
```

In this case, the dropdown ref is not referencing an HTML element, it is referencing a Vue
component.

This is a very handy pattern in certain cases.
