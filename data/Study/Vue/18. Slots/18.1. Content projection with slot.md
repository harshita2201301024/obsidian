A common thing that we need as developers is the ability to build UI components whose content is dynamic.

Of course, Vue supports such a use-case. Itâ€™s easy to "pass" a template snippet to a child component, thanks to slot

slot is a special tag you can use in your templates to include a piece of template provided by the parent component:

```js
<template>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">{{ title }}</h4>
<p class="card-text">
<slot></slot>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
title: string;
}>();
</script>
```
