A common thing that we need as developers is the ability to build UI components whose content is dynamic.

Of course, Vue supports such a use-case. It’s easy to "pass" a template snippet to a child component, thanks to slot

slot is a special tag you can use in your templates to include a piece of template provided by the parent component:

```js
<template>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">{{ title }}</h4>
<p class="card-text">
<slot></slot>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
title: string;
}>();
</script>
```

And you can now use the component like this:

```js
<Card title="Card title">Some quick <strong>example</strong> text</Card>
```

You can also pass a Vue component, for example:

```js
<Card title="Card title">
<Pony :ponyModel="pony" />
</Card>
```

Event though, in the final DOM, the Pony component is displayed inside the Card component, all the expressions (like pony in the above example) are evaluated against the parent component, not against the Card component. The piece of template passed to the Card component doesn’t have access to the state of the Card component.
