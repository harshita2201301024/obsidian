Since Vue v3.3, it is possible to use a new macro called defineSlots (or a slots option if you use defineComponent). This macro has been added to the framework to help declare typed slots. When doing so, Volar will be able to check the slot props.

```js
defineSlots<{
// default slot has no props
default: (props: Record<string, never>) => void;
// title slot has a prop `closeCard`, which is a function
title: (props: { closeCard: () => void }) => void;
}>();
```

If the Card component is not used properly, then Volar throws an error:

```js
<Card>
<template #title="{ close }">...</template>
</Card>
<!-- error TS2339: Property 'close' does not exist on type '{ closeCard: () => void;
}'. -->
```

The returning value of defineProps can be used and is the same object as returned by useSlots.
