Later, you realize that the title can also be some complex HTML. Of course, there is a way to pass multiple contents to the card component, using multiple named slots.

```js
<template>
<div class="card">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">
<slot name="title"></slot>
</h4>
<p class="card-text">
<slot></slot>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</template>
```

The slot with no name is the default one. To provide the title and the content to the Card component, you wrap them into template elements, and name these templates as the slot that they must fill. A template is just an invisible wrapper. To specify a name, you can use v-slot:name:

```js
<Card>
<template v-slot:title>Card title</template>
<template v-slot:default>Some quick <strong>example</strong> text</template>
</Card>
```

You can also use the shorter (and usually preferred) syntax #name:

```js
<Card>
<template #title>Card title</template>
<template #default>Some quick <strong>example</strong> text</template>
</Card>
```

Note that you don’t have to specify #default:

```js
<Card>
<template #title>Card title</template>
<template>Some quick <strong>example</strong> text</template>
</Card>
```

And you can even get rid of the template element around the default slot:

```js
<Card>
<template #title>Card title</template>
Some quick <strong>example</strong> text
</Card>
```

Some built-in components of Vue rely on this mechanism. We will use some of them in the following chapters. As an application developer, you’ll probably end up using it in your own components as well.
