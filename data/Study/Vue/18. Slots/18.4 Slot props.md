As we explained above, the content of the slot can access the current component scope. For example, if we use our card component, we can write:

```js
<Card>
<template #title>Card title</template>
Some quick <strong>{{ example }}</strong> text
</Card>
```

where example is a property of the current component, ant not a property of Card.

But sometimes, you also want to access a property or a method offered by the Card component itself. Letâ€™s imagine that Card has a function to hide the component, called when the user clicks on the "Close" button:

```js
<template>
<div v-if="!isClosed" class="card">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">
<slot name="title">Default title</slot>
</h4>
<p class="card-text">
<slot></slot>
</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" @click="close()">Close</button>
</div>
</div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
const isClosed = ref(false);
const close = () => (isClosed.value = true);
</script>
```

You can see that the component is wrapped in a v-if. When a user clicks on the button, the condition becomes false, and the v-if removes the card.

It works great, but, a few weeks later, the product owner comes back, and asks you to make some cards closable by clicking on a button inside the title passed to the card. To do that, the template passed to the Card component needs to call the close method of the Card component.
