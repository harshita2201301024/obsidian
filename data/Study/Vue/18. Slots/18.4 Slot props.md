As we explained above, the content of the slot can access the current component scope. For example, if we use our card component, we can write:

```js
<Card>
<template #title>Card title</template>
Some quick <strong>{{ example }}</strong> text
</Card>
```

where example is a property of the current component, ant not a property of Card.
