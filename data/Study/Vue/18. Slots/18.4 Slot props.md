As we explained above, the content of the slot can access the current component scope. For example, if we use our card component, we can write:

```js
<Card>
<template #title>Card title</template>
Some quick <strong>{{ example }}</strong> text
</Card>
```

where example is a property of the current component, ant not a property of Card.

But sometimes, you also want to access a property or a method offered by the Card component itself. Letâ€™s imagine that Card has a function to hide the component, called when the user clicks on the "Close" button:

```js
<template>
<div v-if="!isClosed" class="card">
<div class="card-body">
<h4 class="card-title">
<slot name="title">Default title</slot>
</h4>
<p class="card-text">
<slot></slot>
</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" @click="close()">Close</button>
</div>
</div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
const isClosed = ref(false);
const close = () => (isClosed.value = true);
</script>
```

You can see that the component is wrapped in a v-if. When a user clicks on the button, the condition becomes false, and the v-if removes the card.

It works great, but, a few weeks later, the product owner comes back, and asks you to make some cards closable by clicking on a button inside the title passed to the card. To do that, the template passed to the Card component needs to call the close method of the Card component.

This is where we can use slot props. We can expose whatever property or function on the slot by using the usual v-bind:

```js
<h4 class="card-title">
<slot name="title" :closeCard="close">Default title</slot>
</h4>
```

This means that the Card component decides to make its close function available in the template of its title slot, under the name closeCard (we could of course use the same name).

Another term for those properties is scoped props: their scope is limited to a specific slot template.

Now, when we use our Card component, we can access the title props (i.e. the closeCard function) in the slot content:

```js
<Card>
<template #title="titleProps">
<div class="title" @click="titleProps.closeCard()">Card title</div>
</template>
Some quick <strong>example</strong> text
</Card>
```

When you just want to access one or a few properties, you can leverage destructuration to make it slightly prettier:

```js
<Card>
<template #title="{ closeCard }">
<div class="title" @click="closeCard()">Card title</div>
</template>
Some quick <strong>example</strong> text
</Card>
```

Note that when you expose slot properties on the default slot, you can either use a template:

```js
<Card>
<template #default="{ closeCard }">
Some quick <strong>example</strong> text
<button class="close" @click="closeCard()">x</button>
</template>
</Card>
```

or use v-slot directly on the component:

```js
<Card v-slot="{ closeCard }">
Some quick <strong>example</strong> text
<button class="close" @click="closeCard()">x</button>
</Card>
```

We will encounter these syntaxes again in the following chapters!
