Letâ€™s say we want to build a Race component, displaying the ponies engaged in the race.

Such a component can look like:

passing prop to a child component and use it 

required 
defaultValue
prop has by default type and they will always be javascript type not typescript because it was there before typescript support. example of prop types are String, Number, Boolean, Date, Function, Symbol, Object or Array.

11.6.3 Props with validators

Last but not least, you can define a custom validator for the prop. For example, if we have a speed prop, and we want to make sure it is greater than 5:

```js
speed: {
type: Number,
validator: (speed: number) => speed > 5
}
```
