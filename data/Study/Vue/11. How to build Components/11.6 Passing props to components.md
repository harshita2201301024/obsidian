Letâ€™s say we want to build a Race component, displaying the ponies engaged in the race.

Such a component can look like:

passing prop to a child component and use it 

required 
defaultValue
prop has by default type and they will always be javascript type not typescript because it was there before typescript support. example of prop types are String, Number, Boolean, Date, Function, Symbol, Object or Array.

11.6.3 Props with validators

Last but not least, you can define a custom validator for the prop. For example, if we have a speed prop, and we want to make sure it is greater than 5:

```js
speed: {
type: Number,
validator: (speed: number) => speed > 5
}
```

At runtime, Vue validates the prop and warns us if the validation fails:

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">'[Vue warn]: Invalid prop: custom validator check failed for prop "speed".'</mark>

Since Vue v3.4, the validator function is now called with a second argument containing all the props, allowing to validate the value against other props:

```js
min: {
type: Number,
required: true,
validator: (value: number) => value >= 0
},
max: {
type: Number,
required: true,
validator: (value: number, props: { min: number }) => value >= props.min
}
```

All these runtime checks (types, required, validation) are omitted when running the application in production mode.

11.6.4 using props in the setup function

We saw how to use the props in the template, but how can we use them in the setup() function we saw earlier?

Well, it turns out the first parameter of the setup() function can be props! And we can then use our props like any reactive property:

```js
props: {
ponyModel: {
type: Object as PropType<PonyModel>,
required: true
}
},
setup(props) {
const ponyImageUrl = computed(() => `images/pony-${props.ponyModel.color.
toLowerCase()}.gif`);
return { ponyImageUrl };
}
```
