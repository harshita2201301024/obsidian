You will sometimes need to re-compute a value every time another one changes. For example, in the Product component I used above, it would make sense to compute the total, every time the price or quantity changes.

This is super easy in Vue with the computed() function. computed takes a getter function and returns a (readonly) reference:

```js
<template>
<div>{{ price }} * {{ quantity }} = {{ total }}</div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
import { computed, defineComponent, reactive, toRefs } from 'vue';
export default defineComponent({
name: 'Product',
setup() {
const state = reactive({
price: 10,
quantity: 1
});
const total = computed(() => state.price * state.quantity);
// update the price and quantity after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
state.price = 9;
state.quantity = 3;
}, 3000);
return { ...toRefs(state), total };
}
});
</script>
```

And this works right away: Vue detects the reactive properties that total depends on, and tracks them. Every time one of the dependencies updates, Vue runs the getter function again to get the new value. It only works with reactive properties: if state was not a reactive object, but just an object, then the computed property would never be reevaluated.

Computed properties are evaluated lazily: if a computed property is never displayed or use elsewhere, then Vue does not even recompute its value.
