Sometimes, it’s necessary to know when the value of a property changes, but not necessarily to compute the value of another one.

For example, we may want to produce a side effect every time a property changes.

The typical example is a search UI, where you need to ask the server for new results every time the user enters a new query. Or if we go back to our Product component, maybe we want to keep track
of every change of the total value. That’s what the function watchEffect allows doing:

Product.vue
```js
const total = computed(() => state.price * state.quantity)
const totalHistory = ref<Array<string>>([])
watchEffect(
  // this is the effect called when one of its dependencies changes
  () => {
    totalHistory.value.push(`Total changed to ${total.value}`)
  }
)
```

As you can see, we can just define an effect to run, and Vue automatically tracks its dependencies, and re-runs the effect when a dependency changes.

We can access the new value and the old one if we need to, by using watch:

```js
const total = computed(() => state.price * state.quantity)
const totalHistory = ref<Array<string>>([])
watch(
  // this is the source of the watcher
  () => total.value,
  // this is the callback called when the source changes
  (newTotal, oldTotal) => {
    totalHistory.value.push(`Total changed from ${oldTotal} to ${newTotal}`)
  },
  // a watcher with a source is lazy by default
  // whereas a watcher with just an effect and no source is not
  // but we can make it run immediately with this option
  { immediate: true }
)
```

You can also watch an array of reactive values, in order to produce a side effect when any of the values changes. Note that, by default, watch is lazy and won’t run immediately, whereas watchEffect always runs eagerly (as Vue needs to run the effect to find the reactive dependencies it needs to watch, whereas we manually define them with watch).

watch is also handy if you want to run the effect only for certain changes, and not when any of the
reactive dependencies changes (as it does with watchEffect).

If you want, you can stop the watcher by calling the returned function:

```js
const stopRecording = watchEffect(() => {
  totalHistory.value.push(`Total changed to ${total.value}`)
})
function stop() {
  stopRecording()
}

```

You can even ask the watcher to do some cleanup when stopping it:

```js
const stopRecording = watchEffect(
  // the effect takes a parameter
  // which is a function called when the watcher is stopped
  (onCleanup) => {
    totalHistory.value.push(`Total changed to ${total.value}`)
    // clean the history when stop watching
    onCleanup(() => (totalHistory.value = []))
  }
)

```
