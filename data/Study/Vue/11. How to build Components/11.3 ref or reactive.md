So which one to pick? As they are pretty similar, in most cases, it is a matter of taste. Something that helped us understand is:
```
ref(obj) ~= reactive({ value: obj })
```

A ref to an object is pretty much the same as a reactive object containing a value with this object. If that’s still a bit hard to wrap your head around, don’t worry. It took us ages to figure this out ὠ.
Check out the following examples, they may help.

11.3.1. With primitives
No need to think twice, you have to use a ref:

```js
const name = ref('Cédric');
name.value = 'Cyril';
const isAdmin = ref(false);
isAdmin.value = true;
```

11.3.2. With arrays
Arrays can work with both, but can only be reassigned when using a ref.
