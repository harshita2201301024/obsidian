The props object can’t be mutated in the child component. You can mutate the content of a prop if it is an object or an array, but this is considered a bad practice. When a component wants to notify its parent component that something has to be changed, however, it can emit an event. The parent can listen to this event and update its state accordingly.

How do we emit such an event? It turns out that setup(props) can have a second parameter, the context: setup(props, context). context is an object containing several things, and we’ll see some of them later. But right now, we’re only interested in the emit function it contains, so we can use destructuring:

```js
<template>
  <div @click="selectPony()">
    <h2 :style="{ color: ponyModel.color }">{{ ponyModel.name }}</h2>
  </div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent, PropType } from 'vue';
  import { PonyModel } from '@/models/PonyModel';
  export default defineComponent({
  name: 'Pony',
  props: {
  ponyModel: {
  type: Object as PropType<PonyModel>,
  required: true
  }
  },
  emits: {
  // We declare that the only event emitted by the component will be 'selected'
  // and that the emitted value is of type `PonyModel`
  // The function is a validator of the event argument, checked by Vue in
  development mode
  selected: (pony: PonyModel) => pony.color !== 'PURPLE'
  },
  setup(props, { emit }) {
  function selectPony() {
  // we emit a 'selected' event containing the pony entity
  emit('selected', props.ponyModel);
  }
  return { selectPony };
  }
  });
</script>
```
