ref is really handy when working with primitives, as there is no other way to tell Vue that a primitive is reactive. But when working with objects, it can be a bit cumbersome to always write .value.property to update one property of the underlying object:

```js
export default defineComponent({
name: 'Pony',
setup() {
const pony = ref({
name: 'Rainbow Dash',
color: 'GREEN'
});
// update the name after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
pony.value.name = 'Pinkie Pie';
}, 3000);
return { pony };
}
});
```

That’s where reactive() can help! It is very similar to ref in the sense that it declares a property as reactive, and Vue will watch the changes and refresh the template accordingly.

```js
export default defineComponent({
name: 'Pony',
setup() {
const pony = reactive({
name: 'Rainbow Dash',
color: 'GREEN'
});
// update the name after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
pony.name = 'Pinkie Pie';
}, 3000);
return { pony };
}
});
```

As you can see, no need for .value here when we want to update a property, and you can still use {{ pony.name }} in the template!
The cool thing is that works with all the nested properties of the object!

```js
export default defineComponent({
name: 'Pony',
setup() {
const pony = reactive({
name: 'Rainbow Dash',
color: 'GREEN',
origin: {
country: 'FRANCE'
}
});
// update the country of origin after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
pony.origin.country = 'GERMANY';
}, 3000);
return { pony };
}
});
```

It also works with collections and their elements, or when you add and delete property to an object (which was one of the limitations of Vue 2.x, we’ll talk about how this can work in Vue 3 in a later
chapter).
As it is quite handy, you may be tempted to encapsulate your primitives into an object to get rid of ref() and .value, and use reactive() all the time. You definitely can. Let’s say we built a Product component. Instead of:

```js
<template>
<div>{{ price }} * {{ quantity }}</div>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent, ref } from 'vue';
export default defineComponent({
name: 'Product',
86
setup() {
const price = ref(10);
const quantity = ref(1);
// update the price and quantity after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
price.value = 9;
quantity.value = 3;
}, 3000);
return { price, quantity };
}
});
</script>
```
