There are many ways to build a component since Vue 3. The book uses the new Composition API introduced by Vue 3, whereas you may be used to the Options API used in Vue 1 and 2.

Up until now, we mainly focused on how to write the templates, without caring too much about how to write the component itself. But we already mentioned that if we want Vue to update the template of a component, then we have to declare a reactive property.

The core principle of a Vue application is to have a declarative template, displaying data exposed by the component, and refreshing the view every time the data changes. In order for Vue to be able to
implement this magic, it needs to be aware of the changes made to the values displayed in the template. Some frameworks, like Angular, do that by detecting changes every time an event occurs, by comparing the new values of the expressions used in the template with the previous ones. Vue uses another strategy. It uses what it calls "reactive properties".

Reactive properties are properties which can signal that they have been modified. By making properties reactive, you make it possible for Vue to be aware of the changes you make to the properties, and thus to update the DOM when and where necessary.

Letâ€™s start by digging into that.
