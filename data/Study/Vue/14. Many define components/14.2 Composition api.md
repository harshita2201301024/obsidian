Vue 3 introduced the Composition API after an intense discussion and feedback from the
community. The idea is to provide a flexible API with a top-notch TypeScript experience. This API concentrates most work in the setup property of the component definition.

```js
<template>
<div>{{ price }} * {{ quantity }} = {{ total }}</div>
<CustomButton @click="addOne()">Add 1 unit</CustomButton>
</template>
<script lang="ts">
import { computed, defineComponent, ref } from 'vue';
import CustomButton from '@/chapters/many-ways/CustomButton.vue';
export default defineComponent({
name: 'Product',
components: {
CustomButton
},
setup() {
const price = ref(10);
const quantity = ref(1);
const total = computed(() => price.value * quantity.value);
const addOne = () => quantity.value++;
return { price, quantity, total, addOne };
}
});
</script>
```

14.3 Script Setup

Vue 3.2 introduced another way to declare your component, based on the Composition API, but slightly less verbose, by adding a setup attribute to the script element of your SFC:

```js
<template>
<div>{{ price }} * {{ quantity }} = {{ total }}</div>
<CustomButton @click="addOne()">Add 1 unit</CustomButton>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed, ref } from 'vue';
import CustomButton from '@/chapters/many-ways/CustomButton.vue';
const price = ref(10);
const quantity = ref(1);
const total = computed(() => price.value * quantity.value);
const addOne = () => quantity.value++;
</script>
```

As you can see, this syntax removes a lot of boilerplate, as everything in the script section is
automatically exposed to the template. It draws its inspiration from the Svelte framework, and is currently the preferred way to define components. This is what we’ll use throughout the rest of the book and of the exercises. We’ll dive into this in the next chapter! Let’s finish our tour for the moment.

14.4 Class API
Vue 2 had a class API to declare components, which used to be the best way to use TypeScript, and this is still supported in Vue 3. But the tooling doesn’t support this as well as the other options, as the recommended way to use TypeScript is the Composition API with script setup nowadays.

This API was even considered to be the default one in Vue 3, but after a long discussion within the community, the Composition API was preferred.
