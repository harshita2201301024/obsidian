The book uses the new Composition API introduced by Vue 3, whereas you may be used to the
Options API used in Vue 1 and 2, which is still usable in Vue 3. Vue 3 also offers another approach, heavily inspired by the Svelte framework. Letâ€™s review these alternative.

This is the historical way to build Vue components. You have an object, in which you can define
reactive data with data, methods with methods, computed data with computed, etc. This is totally fine and still supported in Vue 3, but is mainly around for compatibility purpose. It does not offer the same flexibility as the Composition API, forcing developers to use Mixins to share behavior.
