Fairly often in an application, you’ll end up with components that need to share the same logic, like calling the same HTTP API.

Instead of copy/pasting the code, we can extract the common logic in a separate file. For example if several components need to do some user-related business, like authenticate, logout, register, etc… we can write these functions in a dedicated file.

To take advantage of the composition API, we should however return these functions as part of an object, returned by a useUserService function:

```js
import { UserModel } from '@/models/UserModel';
async function authenticate(login: string, password: string): Promise<UserModel> {
// call the HTTP API
}
function logout(): void {
// ...
}
```

```js
export function useUserService() {
return {
authenticate,
logout
};
}
```

```js
setup() {
const credentials = {
login: '',
password: ''
};
const userService = useUserService();
async function login() {
await userService.authenticate(credentials.login, credentials.password);
}
return { credentials, login };
}
```

To sum up, you can extract logic in a use… function returning an object, exposing functions
(synchronous or asynchronous) and even reactive references with ref or reactive. The use…
function can also add watchers, computed properties or lifecycle hooks. These functions can be used to simply group related logic together and simplify a component, or can be shared between components, to avoid copy/pasting, and even to let them easily communicate between them.

13.4 A community example: VueUse

The great thing with this pattern is that these composables can be extracted and re-used. VueUse is an open-source library from the Vue community which collects a ton of utility functions.

. useTitle: to change the title of the page
• useGeolocation: to get the location of your user
• useQRCode: to generate QR codes
• useBreakpoints: to be notified of a change of the viewport in your code (similar to a media query
in CSS)
• useClipboard: to read or write some content to the clipboard easily

```js
<template>
<div>{{ coords.latitude }} - {{ coords.longitude }}</div>
<img :src="qrcode" alt="Become a Ninja with Vue 3" />
</template>
<script lang="ts">
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
import { useGeolocation, useTitle } from '@vueuse/core';
import { useQRCode } from '@vueuse/integrations/useQRCode';
export default defineComponent({
name: 'VueUse',
setup() {
// change the title
useTitle('VueUse is awesome');
// get the position of the user
const { coords } = useGeolocation();
// generate a QR code for the ebook
const qrcode = useQRCode('https://books.ninja-squad.com/vue');
return { coords, qrcode };
}
});
</script>
```
