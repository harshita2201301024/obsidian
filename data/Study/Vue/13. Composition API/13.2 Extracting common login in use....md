Fairly often in an application, you’ll end up with components that need to share the same logic, like calling the same HTTP API.

Instead of copy/pasting the code, we can extract the common logic in a separate file. For example if several components need to do some user-related business, like authenticate, logout, register, etc… we can write these functions in a dedicated file.

To take advantage of the composition API, we should however return these functions as part of an object, returned by a useUserService function:

```js
import { UserModel } from '@/models/UserModel';
async function authenticate(login: string, password: string): Promise<UserModel> {
// call the HTTP API
}
function logout(): void {
// ...
}
```

```js
export function useUserService() {
return {
authenticate,
logout
};
}
```

```js

```
