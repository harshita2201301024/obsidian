Fairly often in an application, you’ll end up with components that need to share the same logic, like calling the same HTTP API.

Instead of copy/pasting the code, we can extract the common logic in a separate file. For example if several components need to do some user-related business, like authenticate, logout, register, etc… we can write these functions in a dedicated file.
