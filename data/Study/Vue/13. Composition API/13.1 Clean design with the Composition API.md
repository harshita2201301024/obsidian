Let’s imagine a component Order where a user can order a product with a certain quantity. We
want to display the product information and the total price. We also want to let the user increase or decrease the quantity. And finally, we want to track when the user enters and exits the component, for analytics purpose.

One of the interesting aspects of the Composition API is that all the code related to a given concern can be written in a single place, separated from the code related to other concerns. And we can even extract some shared component logic outside of components.

order.vue Messy code

```js
setup(props) {
const product = ref<ProductModel | null>(null);
const quantity = ref(0);
const price = computed(() => quantity.value * (product.value?.unitPrice ?? 0));
onMounted(async () => {
// log a trace that the user entered this page
await trace('enter');
});
// fetch the product data on initialization and refresh them if the props change
watchEffect(async () => {
product.value = await getProduct(props.productId);
});
function increaseQuantity() {
quantity.value += 1;
}
function decreaseQuantity() {
if (quantity.value > 0) {
quantity.value -= 1;
}
}
async function order() {
// place the order
}
onUnmounted(async () => {
// log a trace that the user left this page
await trace('exit');
});
return { product, quantity, price, increaseQuantity, decreaseQuantity, order };
}
```

This is fairly understandable, but the different concerns of the component are mixed with each
other.

It would have been even worse in Vue 2.x. As you may know, the Composition API has been
introduced in Vue 3.0. Previously, you had to use (and you can still use) the Options API with
several fields to declare:

• the reactive properties in data;
• the methods in methods;
• the watchers in watch;
• the computed properties in computed;
• the lifecycle hooks each in a dedicated field like mounted, destroyed, etc.

So for a big component, you ended up with the logic split across the different definition fields.

One of the interesting aspects of the Composition API is that all the code related to a given concern can be written in a single place, separated from the code related to other concerns. And we can even extract some shared component logic outside of components.

Let’s refactor our Order component, by extracting the related business logic in dedicated functions.

Vue has a convention that you can follow: implement a function named use… returning an object with the different reactive properties and functions. We’ll see in later chapters that a lot of libraries use that convention. The Vue router, for example, exposes a useRouter function.

So here we could extract a useTracking function, outside our component, dedicated to tracking our users:

```js
function useTracking() {
onMounted(async () => {
// log a trace that the user entered this page
await trace('enter');
});
onUnmounted(async () => {
// log a trace that the user left this page
await trace('exit');
});
}
```

A useProduct function, dedicated to the business logic related to the product:

```js
function useProduct(productId: Ref<number>) {
const product = ref<ProductModel | null>(null);
// fetch the product data on initialization and refresh them if the props change
watchEffect(async () => {
product.value = await getProduct(productId.value);
});
return product;
}
```

And finally a useOrderService function, related to all the actions for ordering:

```js
function useOrderService(product: Ref<ProductModel | null>) {
const quantity = ref(0);
const price = computed(() => quantity.value * (product.value?.unitPrice ?? 0));
function increaseQuantity() {
quantity.value += 1;
}
function decreaseQuantity() {
if (quantity.value > 0) {
quantity.value -= 1;
}
}
async function order() {
// place the order
}
return
```
