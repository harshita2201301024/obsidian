Letâ€™s imagine a component Order where a user can order a product with a certain quantity. We
want to display the product information and the total price. We also want to let the user increase or decrease the quantity. And finally, we want to track when the user enters and exits the component, for analytics purpose.

One of the interesting aspects of the Composition API is that all the code related to a given concern can be written in a single place, separated from the code related to other concerns. And we can even extract some shared component logic outside of components.
