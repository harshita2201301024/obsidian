Be careful with premature optimization. Always measure before and after. Beware
off the benchmarks you find on the internets: it’s pretty easy to make them say
what the authors want.
Performances can mean a lot of things: speed, CPU usage (battery consumption), memory
pressure…
Everything is not important for everybody: you have different needs if you are programming for a
mobile website, an e-commerce platform, or a classic CRUD application.
Performances can also be split into different categories, that, once more, won’t all matter to you:
first load, reload, and runtime performances.
First load is when you open an application for the first time. Reload is when you come back to that
application. Runtime performances is what happens when the application is running. Some of the
following recommendations are very generic, and could be applied to any framework. We wrote
them down because we think it’s worth knowing. And because when you talk about performances,
the framework is sometimes the bottleneck, but really (really) often not.

30.1. First load
When you load a modern Web application in your browser, a few things happen. First, the
index.html is loaded and parsed by the browser. Then the JS scripts and other assets referenced are
fetched. When one of the assets is received, the browser parses it, and executes it if it is a JS file.
30.2. Asset sizes
So the first tip is very obvious: be careful with your asset sizes!
The assets loading phase depends on how many assets you want to load. A lot will be slow. Big ones
will be slow. Especially if the network is not that good, which happens more often than you think:
you might test your application on an optical fiber connection, but some of your actual users might
be in the middle of nowhere, using slow 3G. Here is what you can do.

30.3. Bundle your application
When you write your Vue application, you have imports all over the place, and your code is split
across hundreds of files. But you don’t want your users to load hundreds of files! So before shipping
your application, you want to make a "bundle": group all the JavaScript files into one file.
Rollup (for Vite) or Webpack (for the CLI) jobs are to take all your JavaScript files (and CSS, and
template HTML files) and build bundles.
They are not easy tools to master, but Vite and the Vue CLI do a pretty good job at hiding their
complexity. If you don’t use Vite or the CLI, you can build your application with Rollup or Webpack
directly, or you can pick another tool that may produce even better results. But be warned that this
requires quite a lot of expertise (and work) to not mess things up, just to save a few extra kilobytes.
I would recommend staying with Vite (ideally) or the CLI.
The team working on these tools are doing a very good job keeping up with the latest Vue,
TypeScript and bundler releases.
