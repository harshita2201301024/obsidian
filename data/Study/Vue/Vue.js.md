What are web components?

Vue.js is built on top of web components

we have a library with the name of webComponent.js. which have template

 _Note that the wrapping_ _div_ _is not necessary as Vue templates now allow having several root_

_elements (that was not the case until Vue 3.0)._

_If you want Vue to reflect the changes of a variable, you have to create a reactive property using_

_ref__. Weâ€™ll come back to the_ _ref_ _syntax in details in a following chapter dedicated to components._

_But for now the only thing you need to know is that a_ _ref_ _is just an object with a_ _value_ _property._
