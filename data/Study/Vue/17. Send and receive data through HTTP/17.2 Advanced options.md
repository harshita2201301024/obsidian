Of course, you can tune your requests more finely. Every method takes a config object as an optional parameter, where you can configure your request. A few options are really useful, and you can override everything in the request.

params represents the URL search parameters (also known as the query string) to add to the URL.
```
const params = {
sort: 'ascending',
page: '1'
};
const response = await axios.get<Array<RaceModel>>('/api/races', { params });
// will call the URL /api/races?sort=ascending&page=1
```
