Of course, you can tune your requests more finely. Every method takes a config object as an optional parameter, where you can configure your request. A few options are really useful, and you can override everything in the request.

params represents the URL search parameters (also known as the query string) to add to the URL.
```js
const params = {
sort: 'ascending',
page: '1'
};
const response = await axios.get<Array<RaceModel>>('/api/races', { params });
// will call the URL /api/races?sort=ascending&page=1
```

The headers option is often useful to add a few custom headers to your request.
It happens to be necessary for some authentication techniques like JSON Web Token for example:

```js
const headers = { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` };
const response = await axios.get<Array<RaceModel>>('/api/races', { headers });
```
