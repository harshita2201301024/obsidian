It won’t come as a surprise, but a lot of our job consists in asking a backend server to send data to our webapp, and then sending data back.

Usually this is done over HTTP, even though you have other alternatives nowadays, like WebSockets. Vue does not provide an HTTP module, but there are more and more libraries that we can use to send HTTP requests.

One of the possibilities is the fetch API, which is available in most standard browsers. You can perfectly build your app using fetch.

But many developers are using the axios library to build their applications. Axios is based on promises and can be used both in Node.js or browser applications.

And it comes with some nice features that fetch does not offer. Let’s dive in!

```
import axios from 'axios';
```

It offers several methods, matching the most common HTTP verbs:

• get
• post
• put
• delete
• patch
• head

All these methods return a Promise, so you can either chain a then call, or use async/await, which is my favorite.

axios return the data in response.data

Of course, you also have access to the full HTTP response, with a few fields like the status code, headers, etc.


```
const response = await axios.get<Array<RaceModel>>('/api/races');
// status contains 200
const status = response.status;
// headers contains []
const headers = response.headers;
```
