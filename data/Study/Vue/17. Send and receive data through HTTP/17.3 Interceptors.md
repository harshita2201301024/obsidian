One of the reasons to use Axios over the Fetch API is the "interceptors" feature. Interceptors are interesting when you want toâ€¦ intercept requests or responses in your application

For example, if you want to intercept every request to add a specific header to some of them, you can now write an interceptor like this one:

```js
axios.interceptors.request.use((config: InternalAxiosRequestConfig) => {
if (user) {
config.headers!.Authorization = `Bearer ${user.token}`;
}
return config;
});
```

Now every request will go through the interceptor, and receive the custom header if needed (here if there is a user logged in).

You can also intercept the response, which can be handy to handle errors generically:
