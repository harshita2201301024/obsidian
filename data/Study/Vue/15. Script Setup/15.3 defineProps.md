Vue offers a defineProps helper that you can use to define your props. It’s a compile-time helper (a macro), so you don’t need to import it in your code: Vue automatically understands it when it compiles the component.

defineProps returns the props:

```js
const props = defineProps({
ponyModel: {
type: Object as PropType<PonyModel>,
required: true
},
isRunning: {
type: Boolean,
default: false
}
});
```

defineProps receives the former props declaration as a parameter. But we can do even better for TypeScript users!

```
```

defineProps is generically typed: you can call it without a parameter, but specify an interface as the "shape" of the props. No more horrible Object as PropType<Something> to write! We can use proper TypeScript types, and add ? to mark a prop as not required ὠ.

```js
const props = defineProps<{
ponyModel: PonyModel;
isRunning?: boolean;
}>();
```
