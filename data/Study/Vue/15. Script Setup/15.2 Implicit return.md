We can also remove the return at the end: all the top-level bindings declared inside a script setup
(and all imports) are automatically available in the template. So here ponyImageUrl and clicked are
available without needing to return them.
This is the same for the components declaration! Importing the CustomImage component is enough,
and Vue understands that it is used in the template: we can remove the components declaration.
