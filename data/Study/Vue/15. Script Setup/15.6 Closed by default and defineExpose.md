There is a more subtle difference between the two ways to declare components: a script setup
component is "closed by default". This means other components don’t see what’s defined inside the component.

For example, the Pony component can access the CustomImage component (by using refs, as we’ll see in a following chapter). If CustomImage is defined with defineComponent, then everything returned by the setup function is also visible for the parent component (Pony). If CustomImage is defined with script setup, then nothing is visible for the parent component. CustomImage can pick what is exposed by adding a defineExpose({ key: value }) helper. Then the exposed value will be accessible as key.

This syntax is now the recommended way to declare your components. The rest of this book, and the exercises of our online training, use it.
