It is fairly common to want to map a URL to a component of the application. That makes sense: you want your user to be able to bookmark a page and come back, and it provides a better experience overall.

The piece in charge of doing this job is called a router, and every framework has its own (or several ones). Vue is no exception and vue-router is the official router.
