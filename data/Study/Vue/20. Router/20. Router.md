It is fairly common to want to map a URL to a component of the application. That makes sense: you want your user to be able to bookmark a page and come back, and it provides a better experience overall.

The piece in charge of doing this job is called a router, and every framework has its own (or several ones). Vue is no exception and vue-router is the official router.

The router has a simple goal: the creation of meaningful URLs reflecting the state of our app, and each URL knowing what component should be initialized and inserted in the page. It will navigate from route to route without refreshing the page and without triggering a new request to our backend server: this is the whole point of having a Single Page Application (SPA).
