A common use-case is to have a URL simply redirect to another URL in the application. This can happen because you want, for example, the root URL of your news app to redirect to the /breaking news category, or an old URL to redirect to a new one after a refactoring. This is possible using:

```js
{
path: '/news',
redirect: '/breaking'
},
```
