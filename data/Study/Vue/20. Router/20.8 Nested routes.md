As we have seen before, when the router activates a route, the component of the route is inserted in the page at the location marked by the RouterView component.

This mechanism can in fact be used in nested components, too. Suppose you have a complex page
to display the profile of a pony. This page would display its name and portrait at the top, and would
have several tabs at the bottom: one to display its birth certificate, one to display its track record,
and one to display journalist reviews about this pony. You want to have a URL for each tab, in order
to be able to directly link to them. But you donâ€™t want to reload the pony and repeat its name and
portrait on every on these three tab components.

The solution is to use a nested RouterView in the template of the Pony component, and to define a
parent pony route, this way:

```js
{
path: '/ponies/:ponyId',
component: Pony,
children: [
{ path: 'birth-certificate', component: BirthCertificate },
{ path: 'track-record', component: TrackRecord },
{ path: 'reviews', component: Reviews }
]
},
```

When going to the URL /ponies/42/reviews, for example, the router will insert the Pony component
at the location indicated by the main RouterView, in the App component. The template of Pony,
besides the name and the portrait of the pony, contains a second RouterView. This is where the child
Reviews component will be inserted.
