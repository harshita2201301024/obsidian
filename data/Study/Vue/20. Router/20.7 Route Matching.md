You can also define a route that would catch all non matched URLs:

```js
{
path: '/:catchAll(.*)',
redirect: '/404'
}
```

The star can also be used in patterns like path: '/pony-*', which would match /pony-rainbow-dash and /pony-pinkie-pie.

Note that the router matches the most specific route it finds.
