Letâ€™s start using the router. It is an optional plugin, that is thus not included in the core framework.

As we saw for the other third-party dependencies, you have to install it and include it in your application if you want to use it. But for that, we need a configuration to define the mapping between URLs and components. We can do this with a dedicated file, for example named like router.ts, and containing an array representing the configuration:


router.ts
```js
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import Home from '@/views/Home.vue';
import Races from '@/views/Races.vue';
const routerPlugin = createRouter({
history: createWebHistory(),
routes: [
{
path: '/',
name: 'home',
component: Home
},
{
path: '/races',
name: 'races',
component: Races
},
]
});
export default routerPlugin;
```

The exported routerPlugin object must then be used when we create our application, in main.ts:

main.ts
```js
createApp(App)
.use(routerPlugin)
.mount('#app');
```
