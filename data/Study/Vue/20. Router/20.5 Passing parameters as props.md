One cool thing with the router is that you can pass the parameters as props. It decouples the component from the router, and makes it usable as a route, or a simple component used in another one.

To do so, simply add props: true in your route definition:

```js
{
path: '/users/:userId',
name: 'user',
component: User,
props: true
}
```
