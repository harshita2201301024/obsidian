One cool thing with the router is that you can pass the parameters as props. It decouples the component from the router, and makes it usable as a route, or a simple component used in another one.

To do so, simply add props: true in your route definition:

```js
{
path: '/users/:userId',
name: 'user',
component: User,
props: true
}
```

Then our User component must declare the userId prop, and can use it:

```js
const props = defineProps<{
userId: string;
}>();
const user = ref<UserModel | null>(null);
// ... fetch the user details
watchEffect(async () => (user.value = await getUser(props.userId)));
```

As you can see, there is no reference to the router in the component anymore.
