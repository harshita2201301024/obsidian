It is also possible to have parameters in the URL, and it’s really useful to define dynamic URLs. For example, we want to display a detail page for a pony, with a meaningful URL for this page, like races/id-of-the-race/ponies/id-of-the-pony.

To do so, let’s define a route in the configuration with two dynamic parameters.

```js
{
path: '/races/:raceId/ponies/:ponyId',
name: 'pony',
component: Pony
},
```

We can then define dynamic links with RouterLink:

```js
<RouterLink :to="{ name: 'pony', params: { raceId: race.id, ponyId: pony.id } }">
Pony</RouterLink>
```
