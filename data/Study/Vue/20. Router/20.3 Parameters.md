It is also possible to have parameters in the URL, and it’s really useful to define dynamic URLs. For example, we want to display a detail page for a pony, with a meaningful URL for this page, like races/id-of-the-race/ponies/id-of-the-pony.

To do so, let’s define a route in the configuration with two dynamic parameters.

```js
{
path: '/races/:raceId/ponies/:ponyId',
name: 'pony',
component: Pony
},
```

We can then define dynamic links with RouterLink:

```js
<RouterLink :to="{ name: 'pony', params: { raceId: race.id, ponyId: pony.id } }">
Pony</RouterLink>
```

Of course, the target component needs to access those parameters to be able to load and display the pony with the given identifier. To get the value of the parameters, the route object returned by useRoute() represents the current route and can be used inside your setup. It is a reactive reference, with a params property. This field has all the parameters of the URL.
