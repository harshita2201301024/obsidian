Some routes of the application should not be accessible to all users, depending on their
permissions. Of course, you should hide or disable links pointing to these routes if the user may not
access them. You should also make sure the backend doesn’t allow accessing or modifying
resources that the user isn’t authorized to access or modify. But that still won’t prevent users from
accessing routes that they’re not allowed to access, who can simply enter their URL in the address
bar.

That’s where navigation guards come into play. There are 3 kinds of guards:
• global guards: they apply to all the routes of the application;
• route guards: they apply to the route where they are defined;
• in-component guards: they apply to the component where they are defined.
Let’s start with the global ones!
