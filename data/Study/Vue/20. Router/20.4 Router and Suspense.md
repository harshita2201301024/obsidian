RouterView also offers a v-slot API, allowing us to write:
```js
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
	<component :is="Component" />
</RouterView>
```

```
<component is="Races"> 
```

is a syntax offered by Vue to load a component, here Races. is can of course
be dynamic, allowing us to dynamically load a component 
```
<component :is="Component" > 
```

with Component the variable containing the component to load.
It might not seem really useful, but it’s very handy for some advanced use-cases, like for animations
or when using Suspense
