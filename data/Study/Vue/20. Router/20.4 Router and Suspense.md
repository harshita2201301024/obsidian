RouterView also offers a v-slot API, allowing us to write:
```js
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
	<component :is="Component" />
</RouterView>
```

<component is="Races"> is a syntax offered by Vue to load a component, here Races. is can of course
be dynamic, allowing us to dynamically load a component: <component :is="Component"> with
Component the variable containing the component to load.
