RouterView also offers a v-slot API, allowing us to write:
```js
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
	<component :is="Component" />
</RouterView>
```

```
<component is="Races"> 
```

is a syntax offered by Vue to load a component, here Races. is can of course
be dynamic, allowing us to dynamically load a component 
```
<component :is="Component" > 
```

with Component the variable containing the component to load.
It might not seem really useful, but itâ€™s very handy for some advanced use-cases, like for animations
or when using Suspense

```js
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
<Alert v-if="error" variant="danger">An error occurred while loading.</Alert>
<Suspense v-else timeout="0">
<component :is="Component" />
<template #fallback>Loading...</template>
</Suspense>
</RouterView>
```
