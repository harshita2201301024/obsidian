RouterView also offers a v-slot API, allowing us to write:
```js
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
	<component :is="Component" />
</RouterView>
```

<component is="Races"> is a syntax offered by Vue to load a component, here Races. is can of course
be dynamic, allowing us to dynamically load a component: <component :is="Component"> with
Component the variable containing the component to load.

It might not seem really useful, but itâ€™s very handy for some advanced use-cases, like for animations
or when using Suspense


```
_<RouterView_ _v-slot=__"{ Component }"__>_

_<Alert_ _v-if=__"error"_ _variant=__"danger"__>__An error occurred while loading.__</Alert>_

_<Suspense_ _v-else timeout=__"0"__>_

_<component_ _:is=__"Component"_ _/>_

_<template_ _#fallback__>__Loading...__</template>_

_</Suspense>_

_</RouterView>_
```
