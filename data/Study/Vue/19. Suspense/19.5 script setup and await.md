You may have noted that this chapter uses components defined with defineComponent. This is on purpose to explain the async keyword we need to add. But what happens if we use script setup?

Then there is no need to add async: the Vue compiler takes care of it for us!

```js
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { usePonyService } from './PonyService';
const props = defineProps<{
ponyId: number;
}>();
const ponyService = usePonyService();
const trackRecord = ref(await ponyService.getTrackRecord(props.ponyId));
</script>
```
