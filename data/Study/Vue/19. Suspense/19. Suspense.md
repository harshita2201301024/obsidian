 This API is experimental and may change in the future.

When a component needs some asynchronous data, we saw that we can wait for these data in the onMounted hook.

For example, let’s say we want to display a pony and its track record.

The Pony component could look like:

```js
<div>
<h1>Pony {{ ponyModel.name }}</h1>
<TrackRecord :ponyId="ponyModel.id" />
</div>
```

TrackRecord is a component with the following template:

```js
<div>
<h2>Track record</h2>
<ul>
<li v-for="record in trackRecord" :key="record.id">{{ record.position }} - {{
record.race.name }}</li>
</ul>
</div>
```
