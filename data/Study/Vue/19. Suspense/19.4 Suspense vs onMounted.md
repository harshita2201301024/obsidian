So what’s the point of using Suspense instead of onMounted? Both are fine to be honest. An async setup is slightly less verbose than using onMounted, but you then have to use a Suspense to display it. The biggest strength of Suspense is that it works with one, several, or even deeply nested async components. It provides a nice way to handle the loading and error states in a centralized way,
even if you are loading a big tree of async components that won’t resolve at the same time.
