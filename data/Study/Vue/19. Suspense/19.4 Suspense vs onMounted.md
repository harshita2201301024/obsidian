So what’s the point of using Suspense instead of onMounted? Both are fine to be honest. An async setup is slightly less verbose than using onMounted, but you then have to use a Suspense to display it. The biggest strength of Suspense is that it works with one, several, or even deeply nested async components. It provides a nice way to handle the loading and error states in a centralized way,
even if you are loading a big tree of async components that won’t resolve at the same time.

onMounted is still useful though. It is still required if you want to manipulate the DOM when the component is created. It also behaves differently:

when using Suspense, the async component won’t show until the data are loaded

when using onMounted, the component shows right away with no data, then the data are displayed when they are loaded.

Suspense is still experimental, and is expected to be stable with the Vue 3.1 release.
