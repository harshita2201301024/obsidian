We can add fallback content to our Suspense, by providing a template element named fallback:

```js
<div>
<h1>Pony {{ ponyModel.name }}</h1>
<Suspense>
<div>
<TrackRecord :ponyId="ponyModel.id" />
</div>
<template #fallback>Loading...</template>
</Suspense>
</div>
```

Suspense now displays Loading… until the TrackRecord component is ready, and then replaces Loading… with it!

Suspense can even wait for several async components, and displays the fallback content until they
are all available.
