Note that Suspense offers two events that you can listen to:

• resolve, emitted when all the child components to display are resolved;
• pending, emitted when a new child component in a pending state appears;
• fallback, emitted when the fallback appears.

You could for example combine these two events to display a loading spinner every time a child component loads, and hide it when nothing is being loaded anymore.
