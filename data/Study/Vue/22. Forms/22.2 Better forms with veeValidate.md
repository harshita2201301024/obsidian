We very often need client-side validation in forms. This is not a replacement for server-side
validation, but it’s nice to tell our users that some values are incorrect in the current form. It also
gives instant feedback, unlike server-side validation.

VeeValidate is here to help us. It works with the v-model directive we just discovered and adds some
nifty features to our forms.

VeeValidate comes with a lot of validation rules, but none of them are included by default. They are
provided in a separate package called @vee-validate/rules. To make your application as small as
possible, you have to declare what validation rules you want to use. You can import all of them at
once, but this is not a good idea, as you’ll probably just use a few.
Let’s list the most common validation rules available:


Let’s list the most common validation rules available:
• required to make a field required
• min:N and max:N to make sure the value has at least/at most N characters
• min_value:N, max_value:N, between to make sure the value is at least/at most N for a number, or
between two values
• email to check if the value is a valid email
• url to check if the value is a valid URL
• alpha, alpha_num, alpha_dash, alpha_space to check that the value is alphabetic only/with
numbers/with dashes/with spaces
• numeric to check that the value is a number
• regex to define your own regular expression
You have some specific rules for inputs of type="file":
• mimes allows defining what MIME types you want to accept for this file
• ext allows defining what extensions you want to accept for this file
• size allows defining the maximum file size
• image only allows image formats
• dimensions allows defining the exact image dimensions
Some rules are meant to cross-validate two fields:
• required_if makes a field required if another one is filled with one of the given values
• confirmed checks if a field has the same value as another one (classical password/confirm
password check).

When you want to use a rule in your application, you have to load it:

```js
import { defineRule } from 'vee-validate';
import { confirmed, min, required } from '@vee-validate/rules';
defineRule('min', min);
defineRule('required', required);
defineRule('confirmed', confirmed);
```
