We very often need client-side validation in forms. This is not a replacement for server-side
validation, but it’s nice to tell our users that some values are incorrect in the current form. It also
gives instant feedback, unlike server-side validation.

VeeValidate is here to help us. It works with the v-model directive we just discovered and adds some
nifty features to our forms.
