We very often need client-side validation in forms. This is not a replacement for server-side
validation, but it’s nice to tell our users that some values are incorrect in the current form. It also
gives instant feedback, unlike server-side validation.

VeeValidate is here to help us. It works with the v-model directive we just discovered and adds some
nifty features to our forms.

VeeValidate comes with a lot of validation rules, but none of them are included by default. They are
provided in a separate package called @vee-validate/rules. To make your application as small as
possible, you have to declare what validation rules you want to use. You can import all of them at
once, but this is not a good idea, as you’ll probably just use a few.
Let’s list the most common validation rules available:


Let’s list the most common validation rules available:
• required to make a field required
• min:N and max:N to make sure the value has at least/at most N characters
• min_value:N, max_value:N, between to make sure the value is at least/at most N for a number, or
between two values
• email to check if the value is a valid email
• url to check if the value is a valid URL
• alpha, alpha_num, alpha_dash, alpha_space to check that the value is alphabetic only/with
numbers/with dashes/with spaces
• numeric to check that the value is a number
• regex to define your own regular expression
You have some specific rules for inputs of type="file":
• mimes allows defining what MIME types you want to accept for this file
• ext allows defining what extensions you want to accept for this file
• size allows defining the maximum file size
• image only allows image formats
• dimensions allows defining the exact image dimensions
Some rules are meant to cross-validate two fields:
• required_if makes a field required if another one is filled with one of the given values
• confirmed checks if a field has the same value as another one (classical password/confirm
password check).

When you want to use a rule in your application, you have to load it:

```js
import { defineRule } from 'vee-validate';
import { confirmed, min, required } from '@vee-validate/rules';
defineRule('min', min);
defineRule('required', required);
defineRule('confirmed', confirmed);
```

As you can see, we could rename the rules, but I usually use the default rule names. Once we
defined the rules we want to use, we can use them in our components to validate inputs.
You can also configure VeeValidate, for example to indicate when the validation happens. By
default, it validates on the events blur and change. But I like to validate on the input event as well


```js
import { configure } from 'vee-validate';
configure({
validateOnInput: true,
});
```

VeeValidate offers two ways to add validations to your forms:
• one based on the Composition API
• one based on components to use in your templates (a pattern called Higher Order Components,
or HOC)

22.2.1. VeeValidate with Composition API

```js
import { useField } from 'vee-validate';
const { value: name, errorMessage: nameErrorMessage, meta: nameMeta } = useField('
name', { required: true });
```

The object returned by useField() has several interesting properties, like the value of the field, that
we can use in a v-model. VeeValidate also handles the validation of the field, and offers an
errorMessage property, which contains the potential error message for our input.

```js
<template>
<label for="name">Name</label>
<input id="name" v-model="name" name="name" />
<div v-if="nameMeta.dirty && !nameMeta.valid" class="error">{{ nameErrorMessage
}}</div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useField } from 'vee-validate';
const { value: name, errorMessage: nameErrorMessage, meta: nameMeta } = useField('
name', { required: true });
</script>
```

useField in fact offers more properties than that on meta:
• valid is a boolean indicating if the field is valid or invalid
• dirty is a boolean indicating if the field is pristine (no value was entered) or dirty (the user
entered a value different than the initial one)
• touched is a boolean indicating if the field has been blurred or not
VeeValidate also helps to validate the whole form state, and provides another composition API
function: useForm().

```js
import { useField, useForm } from 'vee-validate';
const { meta: formMeta, handleSubmit, errors } = useForm();
// add a `name` field to the form, initialized with 'JB'
const { value: name } = useField('name', { required: true }, { initialValue: 'JB' });
// add a `password` field to the form
const { value: password } = useField('password', { required: true });
// the register function has access to the form values directly
const register = handleSubmit(values => {
// this will only be called if the form is valid
console.log(values);
});
```

You can register as many fields as you want. useForm returns an object with a function handleSubmit
that we can use to handle the submission, an object errors, containing the validation errors, and
the same properties as useField in a property meta. With a logic fairly easy to follow: valid is true if
every field is valid, and false if at least one field is invalid; dirty is false if every field is pristine,
and true if at least one field is dirty, etc.
For example, you can disable the submit button of the form if it is invalid:

```js
<template>
<form @submit="register()">
<label for="name">Name</label>
<input id="name" v-model="name" />
<div class="error">{{ errors.name }}</div>
<label for="password">Password</label>
<input id="password" v-model="password" type="password" />
<div class="error">{{ errors.password }}</div>
<!-- button is disabled while the form is invalid -->
<button :disabled="!formMeta.valid">Register</button>
</form>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useField, useForm } from 'vee-validate';
const { meta: formMeta, handleSubmit, errors } = useForm();
// add a `name` field to the form, initialized with 'JB'
const { value: name } = useField('name', { required: true }, { initialValue: 'JB' });
// add a `password` field to the form
const { value: password } = useField('password', { required: true });
// the register function has access to the form values directly
const register = handleSubmit(values => {
// this will only be called if the form is valid
console.log(values);
});
</script>
```

The composition API offered by VeeValidate does the heavy lifting of validating our form and
computing its state. It’s powerful and easy to use. And, as we’ll see in the next section, there is an
even simpler way to use VeeValidate.

22.2.2. VeeValidate with Higher Order Components

Instead of using the Composition API, VeeValidate offers a component to define a form field and to
add validation on this field. This component is named… Field! Field on its own doesn’t do much.
But you can use it with the other component VeeValidate provides: Form. Form emits a submit event
with the values of the form:

```js
<Form @submit="register($event)">
<label for="name">Name</label>
<Field id="name" name="name" rules="required" value="JB" />
<label for="password">Password</label>
<Field id="password" name="password" type="password" rules="required" />
<button type="submit">Register</button>
</Form>
```


You just have to code the function that handles the submission:

```js
import { Field, Form } from 'vee-validate';
function register(values: Record<string, unknown>) {
// { name: string; password: string }
console.log(values);
}
```

As you can see, Field just expects a name, and (by default) displays an input. If you want to give the
field an initial value, you can use the value prop. Or you can also use v-model: that can be handy if
you want to react on value changes! You just have to use a reactive value and a watcher.

```js
const user = reactive({ name: 'Cédric', password: '' });
const passwordStrength = computed(() => computeStrength(user.password));
```

And then add a v-model on your Field:

```js
<Field id="password" v-model="user.password" name="password" type="password"
rules="required" />
<div id="strength">{{ passwordStrength }}</div>
```

You can also specify a type prop (for a type="number" input), or a different element with the as prop
(for example, :as="textarea"). If you want to display some custom HTML, to maybe dynamically
add a class if the field is invalid, you can do it easily:


```js
<Field v-slot="{ field, meta }" v-model="user.name" name="name" rules="required">
<label for="name-input" :class="{ 'text-danger': meta.dirty && !meta.valid }">
Name</label>
<input id="name-input" :class="{ 'is-invalid': meta.dirty && !meta.valid }" vbind="
field" />
</Field>
```

This is a pattern we have already seen in the Slots chapter, and it is a very useful one: the wrapper
component, or Higher Order Component (or HOC), with a slot content.
Field offers a slot prop, containing all the properties that useField() returns.
We can access the meta property as you can see in the previous example, and we can also access the
errorMessage property, which contains the potential error message for our input. We can do even
better, as VeeValidate offers a third component to display error messages: ErrorMessage.

```js
<Field v-slot="{ field, meta }" v-model="user.name" name="name" rules="required">
<label for="name-input" :class="{ 'text-danger': meta.dirty && !meta.valid }">
Name</label>
<input id="name-input" :class="{ 'is-invalid': meta.dirty && !meta.valid }" vbind="
field" />
<ErrorMessage name="name" class="error" />
</Field>
```

VeeValidate is smart enough to not display the message until your user played with the input. So it
does not shout at a poor user who just landed on your page.

The message displayed here is name is not valid., but it can be customized when we configure the
library, using the @vee-validate/i18n package:
\
```js
import { configure } from 'vee-validate';
import { localize } from '@vee-validate/i18n';
configure({
validateOnInput: true,
generateMessage: localize('en', {
messages: {
// use a function
required: context => `The ${context.field} is required.`,
confirmed: context => `The ${context.field} does not match.`,
// or use the special syntax offered by the library
min: 'The {field} must be at least 0:{min} characters.',
}
})
});
```

The message will now be The name is required..
You can also rename the field if you need to, with the label prop:

```js
<Field
v-slot="{ field, meta }"
v-model="user.confirmPassword"
name="confirmPassword"
rules="required|confirmed:@password"
label="password confirmation"
>
<label for="confirm-password-input" :class="{ 'text-danger': meta.dirty &&
!meta.valid }">Confirm password</label>
<input
id="confirm-password-input"
type="password"
:class="{ 'is-invalid': meta.dirty && !meta.valid }"
v-bind="field"
/>
<ErrorMessage name="confirmPassword" class="error" />
</Field>
```

Note that we could use several rules on the same field:

```js
<Field v-slot="{ field, meta }" v-model="user.password" name="password"
rules="required|min:3">
<label for="password-input" :class="{ 'text-danger': meta.dirty && !meta.valid }"
>Password</label>
<input id="password-input" type="password" :class="{ 'is-invalid': meta.dirty &&
!meta.valid }" v-bind="field" />
<ErrorMessage name="password" class="error" />
</Field>
```

Form also offers a few properties in its slot prop, like meta which contains the state of the form (
valid, dirty, etc.).

```js
<Form v-slot="{ meta: formMeta }" @submit="register($event)">
<!-- Several fields... -->
<button :disabled="!formMeta.valid">Register</button>
</Form>
```

A third component is available, FieldArray, to handle array of values. VeeValidate also allows
localizing the messages in your language, defining your own validation rules, adding accessibility
attributes to your fields, etc.
 VeeValidate comes with a devtools plugin, allowing to directly inspect the state of
your form in the devtools of your browser when you are developing ὠ.
 Try our exercise Login ! It’s part of our Pro Pack, and you’ll learn how to build a
complete form with validation rules with VeeValidate.

22.2.3. Custom validators

VeeValidate offers a few built-in rules, but you can also write your own.
A validator rule is fairly simple: it’s a function that returns true if the value is valid, or false if it is
not. It can also directly return the error message, but I usually only use a boolean as a return value.
The function can also return a Promise if you need an asynchronous validation (like checking
something with the server).
Let’s build a simple validator that checks if a value is between 18 and 130.

```js
export function between18And130(value: string) {
return +value >= 18 && +value <= 130;
}
```

You then add the rule, as you do for the built-in ones:

```js
defineRule('between18And130', between18And130);
```

And define a message for this error:

```js
between18And130: context => `The ${context.field} must be between 18 and 130.`,
```

We can now use it in a component:

```js
<Field v-slot="{ field, meta }" name="age" rules="required|between18And130">
```

A validator can also have parameters. Instead of hardcoding the min and max values, we can give
them to the validator.

```js
export function betweenParams(value: string, params: Array<string>) {
const min = +params[0];
const max = +params[1];
return +value >= min && +value <= max;
}
```

We pass parameters using :, and , to separate them.
