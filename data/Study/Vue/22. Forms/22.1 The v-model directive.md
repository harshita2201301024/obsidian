You can apply the v-model directive to an input, a textarea or a select. You give it a property to
update, and it automatically keeps it in sync between the code and the form field.

This is called two-way binding:
• if the property value changes in the code, the value displayed in the template is updated;
• if the user enters a new value, the property value is updated in the code.
