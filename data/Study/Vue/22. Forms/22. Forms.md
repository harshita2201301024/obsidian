Forms are hard: you have to validate the inputs of your user and display errors. Some fields are
required, others are not. Some depend on another field, so you want to react on field changes, etc.
Vue offers a directive we have not seen yet, v-model, to help us build forms, but not much more. You
are on your own for the validation, error messages, etc. Luckily there are some good libraries to
help us.
Let’s go through an example, first by using v-model, and then let’s see what a third party library can
bring to the table.
