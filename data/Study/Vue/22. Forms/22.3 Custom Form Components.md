HTML defines a large set of input types: text, password, checkbox, etc. But sometimes these
standard types don’t fit the bill.

Vue allows defining custom components, and it’s actually possible to make them act as HTML form
controls, i.e. bind them by applying the v-model directive.
Fulfilling its contract is relatively straightforward. You have to:
• accept a prop called modelValue;
• notify Vue that the user changed the value somehow, by emitting an event called
@update:modelValue;
