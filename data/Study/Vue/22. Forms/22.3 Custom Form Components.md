HTML defines a large set of input types: text, password, checkbox, etc. But sometimes these
standard types don’t fit the bill.

Vue allows defining custom components, and it’s actually possible to make them act as HTML form
controls, i.e. bind them by applying the v-model directive.
Fulfilling its contract is relatively straightforward. You have to:
• accept a prop called modelValue;
• notify Vue that the user changed the value somehow, by emitting an event called
@update:modelValue;

We will illustrate all of this using a custom rating component. This component allows rating a
movie, for example, by giving it a note between 0 and 5. But instead of using a number or range input,
we would like the user to do that by simply clicking one of 6 buttons (that would typically be
displayed as star icons, but we’ll leave that out in the following example).
