When you execute your tests, it launches either Electron, Chrome, Firefox or Edge. Or you can launch them in headless mode (i.e. without displaying any window) with:

```js
npm run test:e2e -- --headless
```

which is very handy for running them on a Continuous Integration platform.

Cypress is full of really nice features:
• easy to set up
• easy to mock HTTP responses
. easy to test different viewports (awesome️ for responsive applications)
• nice enough DSL
