Vue has an official testing library called @vue/test-utils.

It is super handy to unit test Vue components, as you can mount a component, and then test not only its functions and state, but also its template and events.

Letâ€™s say we have built a nice Pony component. It has a prop, and it displays an image depending on its color. It also emits an event when the user clicks on it:    

```js
<template>
<figure @click="clicked()">
<img :src="ponyImageUrl" :alt="ponyModel.name" />
<figcaption>{{ ponyModel.name }}</figcaption>
</figure>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed } from 'vue';
import { PonyModel } from '@/models/PonyModel';
const props = defineProps<{
ponyModel: PonyModel;
}>();
const emit = defineEmits<{ ponySelected: [] }>();
const ponyImageUrl = computed(() => `/images/pony-${props.ponyModel.color.
toLowerCase()}.gif`);
function clicked() {
emit('ponySelected');
}
</script>

```

We want to test that the template is displaying an image with the correct source. vue-test-utils offers a mount function to create an instance of the component:
