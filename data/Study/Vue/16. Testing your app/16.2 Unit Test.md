As we saw earlier, unit tests are there to check a small unit of code in isolation. These tests can only verify that a small part of your app works as intended, but they have several advantages:
• they are really fast - you can run several hundreds of them in a few seconds.
• they are a very efficient way to test (nearly) all your code, especially the tricky cases, which can be hard to manually test in the real app.

One of the core concepts of unit testing is isolation: we don’t want our test to be biased by the
unit’s dependencies. So we usually use "mock" objects as dependencies. These are fake objects that we create just for testing purposes.

To do this, we are going to rely on a few tools. First we need a library to write tests. One of the most popular (if not the most popular), is Jest, but we are going to use my favorite, Vitest!
