I love automated testing. My professional life revolves around the test progress bar going green in my IDE, patting me in the back for doing my job properly. And I hope you do care about tests too, as they are the only safety net we have when we write code. Nothing is more tedious than manually testing code.

Vue does a great job to let us easily write tests, with the help of a few tools.
We can write different types of tests:
• unit tests
• end-to-end tests

The first ones are there to verify that a small unit of code (a component, a service…) works
correctly in isolation, i.e. without considering its dependencies. Writing such a unit test requires
you to execute each of the component or service functions, and check the outputs are what we expected regarding the inputs we fed it. We can also check the dependencies used by this unit are correctly called: for example we can check that a service will do the correct HTTP request.

We can also write end-to-end tests. Their purpose is to emulate a real user interacting with your app, by starting a real instance and then driving the browser to enter values in inputs, click on buttons, etc. We’ll then check the rendered page is in the state we expect, that the URL is correct - whatever you can think of.

We’re going to cover all this, but let’s begin with the unit test part.
