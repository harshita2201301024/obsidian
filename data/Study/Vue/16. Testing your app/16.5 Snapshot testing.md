Another way to test your templates is to use snapshot testing. Vitest can create a snapshot of the DOM created (in a pretty format) and store it in a file along your tests, so it can be reviewed

```js
test('should match the snapshot', () => {
const ponyModel: PonyModel = {
id: 1,
name: 'Fast Rainbow',
color: 'PURPLE'
};
const wrapper = mount(Pony, {
props: {
ponyModel
}
});
expect(wrapper.element).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

When you execute the test for the first time, the test wonâ€™t actually verify anything, but will generate the snapshot. You can then check if it contains the expected DOM structure (and fix the
code until it does).
