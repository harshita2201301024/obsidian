Another way to test your templates is to use snapshot testing. Vitest can create a snapshot of the DOM created (in a pretty format) and store it in a file along your tests, so it can be reviewed

```js
test('should match the snapshot', () => {
const ponyModel: PonyModel = {
id: 1,
name: 'Fast Rainbow',
color: 'PURPLE'
};
const wrapper = mount(Pony, {
props: {
ponyModel
}
});
expect(wrapper.element).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

When you execute the test for the first time, the test won’t actually verify anything, but will generate the snapshot. You can then check if it contains the expected DOM structure (and fix the code until it does).

Once you’re happy with the result, you can save the snapshot in your VCS system (it becomes part of your sources), so that every subsequent test execution verifies that the DOM generated by the
test still matches the saved snapshot

If you use this feature, you’ll see a new snapshots directory appear, containing the test snapshot:

```js
// Vitest Snapshot v1, https://vitest.dev/guide/snapshot.html
exports[`Pony.vue > should match the snapshot 1`] = `
<figure>
<img
alt="Fast Rainbow"
src="/images/pony-purple.gif"
/>
<figcaption>
Fast Rainbow
</figcaption>
</figure>
`
```

Then if you update your template, the test fails and shows you what changed in the snapshot. Here I added an exclamation point after the name of the pony:

```js
Pony.vue › should match the snapshot
expect(received).toMatchSnapshot()
- Expected - 1
+ Received + 1
alt=\"Fast Rainbow\"
src=\"/images/pony-purple.gif\"
/>
<figcaption>
- Fast Rainbow
+ Fast Rainbow!
</figcaption>
</figure>"
