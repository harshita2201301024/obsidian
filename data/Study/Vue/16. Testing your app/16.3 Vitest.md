Vitest is a really cool solution: it’s really similar to Jest (same API, based on jsdom) but faster and more modern.

If you generate your project with create-vue instead of Vue CLI, this is the unit testing solution
you’ll get. Our pro pack exercises all use Vitest of course: you’ll find all kinds of tricks (and
configuration tips) to test everything in your projects!

Vitest has been built to leverage Vite to handle all the transformations when running the unit tests. So you don’t need ts-jest or @vue/vue3-jest. And Vitest works great with ECMAScript Modules, whereas Jest… not so much.

Vitest gives us a few functions to declare our tests:
• describe() declares a test suite (a group of tests)
• test() declares a test
• expect() declares an assertion

All the configuration options goes into either a vitest.config.ts file, or directly inside the Vite
configuration, in a test property.
