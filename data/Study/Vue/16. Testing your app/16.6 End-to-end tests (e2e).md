End-to-end tests are the other type of tests we can run. An end-to-end test consists in really launching your app in a browser and emulating a user interacting with it (clicking on buttons,filling forms, etc.). They have the advantage of really testing the application as a whole, but:

• they are slower (several seconds per test)
• it can be hard to test the edge cases.
