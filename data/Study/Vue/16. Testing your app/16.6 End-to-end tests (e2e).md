End-to-end tests are the other type of tests we can run. An end-to-end test consists in really launching your app in a browser and emulating a user interacting with it (clicking on buttons,filling forms, etc.). They have the advantage of really testing the application as a whole, but:

• they are slower (several seconds per test)
• it can be hard to test the edge cases.

As you may guess, you don’t have to choose between unit tests and e2e tests: you will combine both to have great coverage, and some guarantees that your complete application runs as intended.

Vue CLI offers integration with two e2e testing libraries: Cypress and Nightwatch.js, and create-vue offers support for Cypress out-of-the-box as well. And I am madly in love with Cypress

You can run your e2e tests with:

```js
npm run test:e2e
```
