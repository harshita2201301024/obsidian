### Progress Notes
- Record any major milestones or motivational thoughts here.

## **Staying on Track While Traveling**

### 1. **Plan Ahead**
   - Research hotel gyms or nearby fitness centers to stay on track with your routine.
   - If no gym is available, prioritize bodyweight exercises such as push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks.

### 2. **Modify Your Workout**
   - **Push Routine**: Do push-ups for chest and triceps, and shoulder taps for shoulders.
   - **Pull Routine**: Use resistance bands if available, or do bent-over rows with luggage or pull-ups.
   - **Legs & Abs**: Focus on squats, lunges, and bodyweight ab exercises like crunches and planks.

### 3. **Stay Active with Walking**
   - Walk as much as possible to compensate for lighter workouts.
   - Use stairs and keep moving throughout the day to stay active.

### 4. **Mind Your Diet**
   - Be mindful of portion sizes when eating out.
   - Stick to healthy meals with lean proteins and salads when possible.
   - Stay hydrated and keep protein intake steady with nuts, seeds, or protein bars.

### 5. **Return to Routine**
   - Once back from travel, get back into your gym routine as soon as possible.
   - Don’t worry if you can’t hit your full workout plan during travel—focus on consistency and motivation over the long term.

---

### Motivation Tips
- If you miss a day or can’t hit your goals, don’t get discouraged. Progress is about consistency over time.
- Remember, any movement is better than none. Focus on what you can do, even if it’s small steps while traveling.
