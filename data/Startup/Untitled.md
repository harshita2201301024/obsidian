Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in freelance opportunities in front-end development. With over eight years of experience in crafting high-performance, scalable web applications, I specialize in enhancing user interfaces and optimizing web performance. My work spans various sectors, including government, finance, and e-commerce.

In my recent role at Digital Dubai Government, I led projects that significantly improved user engagement and reduced time-to-market through the implementation of micro-frontend architecture. My technical expertise includes ReactJS, Vue.js, Angular, and various state management libraries, ensuring the delivery of innovative and efficient solutions.

I offer a range of services, including custom web application development, UI/UX consultancy, and performance optimizations. My skills and experience make me confident in my ability to contribute effectively to any project.

I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate on challenging projects and bring creative solutions to life. Please find my resume attached for more details on my experience and skills. I look forward to discussing how I can support your team's goals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,

Aakash Bathla
